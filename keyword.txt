TI  - Generation Z Within the Workforce and in the Workplace: A Bibliometric Analysis.
PG  - 736820
LID - 10.3389/fpsyg.2021.736820 [doi]
AB  - This article aims to improve the knowledge on Generation Z as employees within
      workforce and in the workplace, as well as on the main thematic trends that drive
      the research on the topic. To this end, and using bibliometric techniques, a
      sample of 102 publications on this subject from Web of Science between 2009 and
      2020 is analyzed. Research discusses the most published and most cited authors
      and journals to have a broad view of the context of the subject. Later, through a
      longitudinal view, the study mainly focuses on analyzing the evolution of
      thematic clusters, to assess the progress of the themes, as well as the network
      around the principal motor cluster of each period. The obtained results suggest a
      hardly developed topic, which started to draw attention in 2018, while still
      having a wide margin for growth. The core of research on the topic has evolved
      around "Generation-Z" "generations," "workplace," "management" and "attitudes,"
      "leadership," "career," or "learning-teaching-education," although a low keyword 
      stability among periods was noted. There is a need for further development on a
      variety of aspects regarding this generation and the labor market, as the study
      shows a clear orientation toward management and generational diversity within the
      workplace.

TI  - Emerging Trends and Hot Spots of Electrical Impedance Tomography Applications in 
      Clinical Lung Monitoring.
PG  - 813640
LID - 10.3389/fmed.2021.813640 [doi]
AB  - Objective: This study explores the emerging trends and hot topics concerning
      applications on electrical impedance tomography (EIT) in clinical lung
      monitoring. Methods: Publications on EIT applications in clinical lung monitoring
      in 2001-2021 were extracted from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC). The 
      search strategy was "electrical impedance tomography" and "lung." CiteSpace, a
      VOS viewer was used to study the citation characteristics, cooperation, and
      keyword co-occurrence. Moreover, co-cited reference clustering, structural
      variation analysis (SVA), and future research trends were presented. Results: Six
      hundred and thirty-six publications were included for the final analysis. The
      global annual publications on clinical lung monitoring gradually increased in the
      last two decades. Germany contributes 32.2% of total global publications.
      University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein (84 publications, cited frequency
      2,205), Physiological Measurement (105 publications, cited frequency 2,056), and 
      Inez Frerichs (116 articles, cited frequency 3,609) were the institution,
      journal, and author with the largest number of article citations in the research 
      field. "Electrical impedance tomography" (occurrences, 304), "mechanical
      ventilation" (occurrences, 99), and "acute respiratory distress syndrome"
      (occurrences, 67) were the top most three frequent keywords, "noninvasive
      monitoring" (Avg, pub, year: 2008.17), and "extracorporeal membrane oxygenation" 
      (Avg, pub, year: 2019.60) were the earliest and latest keywords. The keywords
      "electrical impedance tomography" (strength 7.88) and co-cited reference
      "Frerichs I, 2017, THORAX" (strength 47.45) had the highest burst value. "Driving
      pressure," "respiratory failure," and "titration" are the three keywords still
      maintaining a high brush value until now. The largest and smallest cluster of the
      co-cited references are "obstructive lung diseases" (#0, size: 97) and "lung
      perfusion" (#20, size: 5). Co-cited reference "Frerichs I, 2017, THORAX"
      (modularity change rate: 98.49) has the highest structural variability.
      Categories with most and least interdisciplinary crossing are "ENGINEERING" and
      "CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE." Conclusions: EIT is a valuable technology for clinical 
      lung monitoring, gradually converting from imaging techniques to the clinic.
      Research hot spots may continue monitoring techniques, the ventilation
      distribution of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and respiratory
      therapy strategies. More diversified lung function monitoring studies, such as
      lung perfusion and interdisciplinary crossing, are potentially emerging research 
      trends.

AB  - Background: In recent years, tinnitus has attracted increasing research interest.
      However, bibliometric analysis of global research on tinnitus is rare. The
      objective of this study was to identify and describe the foci and developing
      trends of tinnitus research using a bibliometric approach. Methods: Publications 
      related to tinnitus published from 2001 to 2020 were searched for in the Science 
      Citation Index-Expanded (SCI-E) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI)
      databases in the Web of Science Core Collection of Clarivate Analytics. The
      bibliometric approach was used to estimate the searched data, and VOSviewer and
      CiteSpace software were used to identify and analyze research foci and trends in 
      the field of tinnitus. Results: A total of 5,748 articles were included. The
      number of publications on tinnitus has increased dramatically in the last 20
      years, especially since 2010. The leading country in terms of publications and
      access to collaborative networks was the United States. High-frequency keywords
      included tinnitus, hearing loss, prevalence, management, depression, mechanism,
      vertigo, hearing, inferior colliculus, and noise. The analyses of keyword burst
      detection indicated that prevalence, anxiety, and neural network are emerging
      research hotspots. Conclusion: In the past 20 years, academic understanding of
      tinnitus has improved considerably. This study provides an objective, systematic,
      and comprehensive analysis of tinnitus-related literature. Furthermore, current
      hot spots and prospective trends in the field of tinnitus were identified. These 
      results will assist otolaryngologists and audiologists in identifying the
      evolving dynamics of tinnitus research and highlight areas for prospective
      research.

      in Korea.
PG  - 2627
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-06575-z [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of wireless emergency alerts
      (WEAs) on social distancing policy. The Republic of Korea has been providing
      information to the public through WEAs using mobile phones. This study used five 
      data sets: WEA messages, news articles including the keyword "COVID-19," the
      number of confirmed COVID-19 patients, public foot traffic data, and the
      government's social distancing level. The WEAs were classified into two
      topics-"warning" and "guidance"-using a random forest model. The results of the
      correlation analysis and further detailed analysis confirmed that the "warning"
      WEA topic and number of news articles significantly affected public foot traffic.
      However, the "guidance" topic was not significantly associated with public foot
      traffic. In general, the Korean government's WEAs were effective at encouraging
      the public to follow social distance recommendations during the COVID-19
      pandemic. In particular, the "warning" WEA topic, by providing information about 
      the relative risk directly concerning the recipients, was significantly more
      effective than the "guidance" topic.

TI  - Can natural language processing models extract and classify instances of
      interpersonal violence in mental healthcare electronic records: an applied
      evaluative study.
PG  - e052911
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2021-052911 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This paper evaluates the application of a natural language processing 
      (NLP) model for extracting clinical text referring to interpersonal violence
      using electronic health records (EHRs) from a large mental healthcare provider.
      DESIGN: A multidisciplinary team iteratively developed guidelines for annotating 
      clinical text referring to violence. Keywords were used to generate a dataset
      which was annotated (ie, classified as affirmed, negated or irrelevant) for:
      presence of violence, patient status (ie, as perpetrator, witness and/or victim
      of violence) and violence type (domestic, physical and/or sexual). An NLP
      approach using a pretrained transformer model, BioBERT (Bidirectional Encoder
      Representations from Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining) was fine-tuned on
      the annotated dataset and evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation. SETTING: We
      used the Clinical Records Interactive Search (CRIS) database, comprising over 500
      000 de-identified EHRs of patients within the South London and Maudsley NHS
      Foundation Trust, a specialist mental healthcare provider serving an urban
      catchment area. PARTICIPANTS: Searches of CRIS were carried out based on 17
      predefined keywords. Randomly selected text fragments were taken from the results
      for each keyword, amounting to 3771 text fragments from the records of 2832
      patients. OUTCOME MEASURES: We estimated precision, recall and F1 score for each 
      NLP model. We examined sociodemographic and clinical variables in patients giving
      rise to the text data, and frequencies for each annotated violence
      characteristic. RESULTS: Binary classification models were developed for six
      labels (violence presence, perpetrator, victim, domestic, physical and sexual).
      Among annotations affirmed for the presence of any violence, 78% (1724) referred 
      to physical violence, 61% (1350) referred to patients as perpetrator and 33%
      (731) to domestic violence. NLP models' precision ranged from 89% (perpetrator)
      to 98% (sexual); recall ranged from 89% (victim, perpetrator) to 97% (sexual).
      CONCLUSIONS: State of the art NLP models can extract and classify clinical text
      on violence from EHRs at acceptable levels of scale, efficiency and accuracy.

TI  - Nutrition and quality of life in chronic kidney disease patients: a practical
      approach for salt restriction.
LID - 10.23876/j.krcp.21.203 [doi]
AB  - The clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for nutrition in chronic kidney disease
      (CKD) were updated after 20 years from the previous guidelines by the Kidney
      Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI). During this period, the severity of 
      CKD was defined by eGFR and albuminuria by the organization Kidney Disease:
      Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO). Main risk factors for CKD such as
      hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes mellitus 
      are closely related to lifestyle. Nutritional management is important to prevent 
      and retard the progression of CKD. Members of the International Society of Renal 
      Nutrition and Metabolism (ISRNM) reviewed the KDOQI CPG draft. ISRNM is an
      international scientific society comprising members of multiple subspecialties.
      ISRNM proposed the medical term protein-energy wasting (PEW), which is a keyword 
      in renal nutrition. The prevalence of PEW among dialysis patients is high. The
      success of dietary therapy depends on adherence to the diet. It has to be
      palatable, otherwise eating habits will not change. To prevent the development
      and progression of CKD and PEW, regular consultation with an expert dietitian is 
      required, especially regarding salt and protein restriction. Our
      cluster-randomized trial showed that intervention by a dietician was effective at
      retarding the progression of stage 3 CKD. In this review, I focus on salt
      (sodium) restriction and introduce tips for salt restriction and Japanese
      kidney-friendly recipes. Due to the lack of randomized controlled trials,
      nutritional management of CKD inevitably relies on expert opinion. In this
      regard, well-designed observational studies are needed. Too strict salt
      restriction may decrease quality of life and result in PEW.

TI  - The clean energy claims of BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil and Shell: A mismatch between 
      discourse, actions and investments.
PG  - e0263596
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0263596 [doi]
AB  - The energy products of oil and gas majors have contributed significantly to
      global greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and planetary warming over the past
      century. Decarbonizing the global economy by mid-century to avoid dangerous
      climate change thus cannot occur without a profound transformation of their
      fossil fuel-based business models. Recently, several majors are increasingly
      discussing clean energy and climate change, pledging decarbonization strategies, 
      and investing in alternative energies. Some even claim to be transforming into
      clean energy companies. Given a history of obstructive climate actions and
      "greenwashing", there is a need to objectively evaluate current and historical
      decarbonization efforts and investment behavior. This study focuses on two
      American (Chevron, ExxonMobil) and two European majors (BP, Shell). Using data
      collected over 2009-2020, we comparatively examine the extent of decarbonization 
      and clean energy transition activity from three perspectives: (1) keyword use in 
      annual reports (discourse); (2) business strategies (pledges and actions); and
      (3) production, expenditures and earnings for fossil fuels along with investments
      in clean energy (investments). We found a strong increase in discourse related to
      "climate", "low-carbon" and "transition", especially by BP and Shell. Similarly, 
      we observed increasing tendencies toward strategies related to decarbonization
      and clean energy. But these are dominated by pledges rather than concrete
      actions. Moreover, the financial analysis reveals a continuing business model
      dependence on fossil fuels along with insignificant and opaque spending on clean 
      energy. We thus conclude that the transition to clean energy business models is
      not occurring, since the magnitude of investments and actions does not match
      discourse. Until actions and investment behavior are brought into alignment with 
      discourse, accusations of greenwashing appear well-founded.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study was conducted to identify trends in Graves' orbitopathy
      research in the past two decades and to elaborate on hot topics in the field.
      METHODS: The Web of Science database was used to extract articles on Graves'
      orbitopathy or its synonyms. Full data and references were exported to VOSviewer 
      software to be analyzed. Visualization maps and charts were constructed
      accordingly. RESULTS: We retrieved 1067 articles on Graves' orbitopathy from the 
      Web of Science database. The United States ranked first in terms of the article
      count (25), followed by Italy (141) and the People's Republic of China (120).
      Wiersinga's and the University of Amsterdam's articles received the highest
      citation count (1509 and 3052, respectively). The University of Pisa and Thyroid 
      published the highest number of articles (65 and 93, respectively). Co-authorship
      analysis showed four clusters of country collaborations: red cluster, European
      countries; green cluster, the United States, Brazil, Canada, South Korea, and
      Taiwan; a yellow cluster, People's Republic of China; and blue cluster, Japan,
      Australia, and Poland. Keyword analysis revealed five clusters of topics:
      pathogenesis, management, association, quality of life, and surgery. Analysis of 
      co-cited references also revealed five clusters: pathogenesis, management, risk
      factors, clinical assessment, and surgical management. CONCLUSION: Research on
      Graves' orbitopathy has grown during the past two decades. Hot research topics
      are pathogenesis, management, risk factors, quality of life, and complications.
      Research trends have changed in the past two decades. Increasing interest in
      exploring Graves' orbitopathy mechanisms and associations is evident. European
      countries are cooperating in this field of research. The United States has
      established more extensive international cooperation than other countries. We
      believe that more international collaboration involving developing countries is
      required.

TI  - Global prevalence of Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy: a systematic review 
      and meta-analysis.
PG  - 96
LID - 10.1186/s13018-022-02996-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A variety of mutations in the largest human gene, dystrophin, cause a
      spectrum from mild to severe dystrophin-associated muscular dystrophies. Duchenne
      (DMD) and Becker (BMD) muscular dystrophies are located at the severe end of the 
      spectrum that primarily affects skeletal muscle. Progressive muscle weakness in
      these purely genetic disorders encourages families with a positive history for
      genetic counseling to prevent a recurrence, which requires an accurate prevalence
      of the disorder. Here, we provide a systematic review and meta-analysis to
      determine the prevalence of DMD and BMD worldwide. METHOD: The current systematic
      review and meta-analysis was carried out using Cochrane seven-step procedure.
      After determining the research question and inclusion and exclusion criteria, the
      MagIran, SID, ScienceDirect, WoS, ProQuest, Medline (PubMed), Embase, Cochrane,
      Scopus, and Google Scholar databases were searched to find relevant studies using
      defined keywords and all possible keyword combinations using the AND and OR, with
      no time limit until 2021. The heterogeneity of studies was calculated using the
      I(2) test, and the publication bias was investigated using the Begg and Mazumdar 
      rank correlation test. Statistical analysis of data was performed using
      Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software (version 2). RESULTS: A total of 25 articles
      involving 901,598,055 people were included. The global prevalence of muscular
      dystrophy was estimated at 3.6 per 100,000 people (95 CI 2.8-4.5 per 100,000
      people), the largest prevalence in the Americans at 5.1 per 100,000 people (95 CI
      3.4-7.8 per 100,000 people). According to the subgroup analysis, the prevalence
      of DMD and BMD was estimated at 4.8 per 100,000 people (95 CI 3.6-6.3 per 100,000
      people) and 1.6 per 100,000 people (95 CI 1.1-2.4 per 100,000 people),
      respectively. CONCLUSION: Knowing the precise prevalence of a genetic disorder
      helps to more accurately predict the likelihood of preventing its occurrence in
      families. The global prevalence of DMD and BMD was very high, indicating the
      urgent need for more attention to prenatal screening and genetic counseling for
      families with a positive history.

      Trends approach.
LID - 10.1111/hir.12421 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In early the COVID-19 pandemic, routine dental treatments have been
      delayed due to the risk of disease transmission. This delay may lead public to
      search for information on the Internet for a solution. OBJECTIVES: This study
      aims to evaluate the public interest in dentistry in the early months of the
      COVID-19 global pandemic in the selected countries. METHODS: The daily numbers of
      new COVID-19 cases were recorded for China, South Korea, Italy, Germany, Russia, 
      Ukraine and Turkey. For these countries, Internet search interest of the keyword 
      'dentistry', 'coronavirus', 'COVID-19', 'SARS-CoV-2' and 'pandemic' in the early 
      months of the COVID-19 pandemic was evaluated by using Google Trends data.
      RESULTS: In most countries included the public Internet search interest in
      'dentistry+coronavirus+COVID-19+SARS-CoV-2+pandemic' peaked prior to the peak of 
      new COVID-19 cases. While a statistically significant positive correlation was
      observed between the number of new cases and Google Trends data in China, South
      Korea, Italy and Germany, a statistically significant negative correlation was
      observed in Turkey. CONCLUSION: The peak public interest in dentistry has been
      prior to the peak of COVID-19 new cases in most countries. The use of Internet
      data can provide useful information about pandemics and many other diseases.

AB  - Symptom-based machine learning models for disease detection are a way to reduce
      the workload of doctors when they have too many patients. Currently, there are
      many research studies on machine learning or deep learning for disease detection 
      or clinical departments classification, using text of patient's symptoms and
      vital signs. In this study, we used the Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) with a
      fully connected neural network model for classification, where the LSTM model was
      used to receive the patient's symptoms text as input data. The fully connected
      neural network was used to receive other input data from the patients, including 
      body temperature, age, gender, and the month the patients received care in. In
      this research, a data preprocessing algorithm was improved by using keyword
      selection to reduce the complexity of input data for overfitting problem
      prevention. The results showed that the LSTM with fully connected neural network 
      model performed better than the LSTM model. The keyword selection method also
      increases model performance.

      Information Communication Technology.
PG  - 414-422
LID - 10.5644/ama2006-124.363 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the changes in communication in long-term care facilities
      (LTCF) during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A systematic literature review was 
      conducted through a keyword search of the PubMed and Ovid Embase databases. In
      accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 11 articles were selected
      and analysed qualitatively. RESULTS: The use of information communication
      technology was heterogeneous, and it was used to bring together several different
      groups of users: LCTF residents' families, hospitals, specialists, and general
      practitioners. The modes of communication and preferred ways to reduce the social
      isolation of LTCF residents from their family members were described. Various
      smartphone applications have been designed for both socializing and the use of
      telemedical solutions. Opportunities for peer-to-peer social interaction between 
      the elderly through information communication technologies have been neglected.
      CONCLUSION: Video calls may bring greater satisfaction to residents and their

TI  - Stigma towards Mental Disorders among Nursing Students and Professionals: A
      Bibliometric Analysis.
LID - 1839 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19031839 [doi]
AB  - Stigma is one of the main barriers to prevention, treatment and recovery from
      mental illness. However, bibliometric studies in this area are still scarce.
      Therefore, our aim was to quantify and analyze the scientific literature on the
      stigma of nursing students and professionals towards mental disorders. To this
      purpose, bibliometric indicators of scientific production, impact and
      collaboration were used. Among our results, it stands out that only 14.3% of the 
      total number of studies analyzed measure the efficacy of the interventions
      carried out to reduce stigma. Furthermore, with exceptions such as Happell B and 
      Byrne L, collaborations between authors and institutions are limited. "Service
      user involvement" appeared as a prominent keyword in 2018, coinciding with the
      increase in publications on the effectiveness of interventions. Interventions
      based on the involvement of people with psychiatric diagnoses in the design of
      nursing curricula seem to become a promising line of research. More studies
      measuring the efficacy of such interventions are needed. Knowledge of the lines
      of research that are being developed and of the researchers and institutions
      involved can contribute to creating synergy between the different researchers and
      to continue adding projects to the existing ones, thus contributing to the
      generation of more robust results that show the most indicated interventions to
      reduce the still present stigma and improve care for people with psychiatric
      diagnoses.

TI  - Enterprise Data Sharing with Privacy-Preserved Based on Hyperledger Fabric
      Blockchain in IIOT's Application.
LID - 1146 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s22031146 [doi]
AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) technology is now widely used in energy, healthcare,
      services, transportation, and other fields. With the increase in industrial
      equipment (e.g., smart mobile terminals, sensors, and other embedded devices) in 
      the Internet of Things and the advent of Industry 4.0, there has been an
      explosion of data generated that is characterized by a high volume but small
      size. How to manage and protect sensitive private data in data sharing has become
      an urgent issue for enterprises. Traditional data sharing and storage relies on
      trusted third-party platforms or distributed cloud storage, but these approaches 
      run the risk of single-node failure, and third parties and cloud storage
      providers can be vulnerable to attacks that can lead to data theft. To solve
      these problems, this paper proposes a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain-based secure 
      data transfer scheme for enterprises in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT).
      We store raw data in the IIoT in the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) network
      after encryption and store the Keyword-index table we designed in Hyperledger
      Fabric blockchain, and enterprises share the data by querying the Keyword-index
      table. We use Fabric's channel mechanism combined with our designed Chaincode to 
      achieve privacy protection and efficient data transmission while using the
      Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) to ensure data integrity.
      Finally, we performed security analysis and experiments on the proposed scheme,
      and the results show that overall the data transfer performance in the IPFS
      network is generally better than the traditional network, In the case of
      transferring 5 MB file size data, the transmission speed and latency of IPFS are 
      19.23 mb/s and 0.26 s, respectively, and the IPFS network is almost 4 times
      faster than the TCP/IP network while taking only a quarter of the time, which is 
      more advantageous when transferring small files, such as data in the IIOT. In
      addition, our scheme outperforms the blockchain systems mainly used today in
      terms of both throughput, latency, and system overhead. The average throughput of
      our solution can reach 110 tps (transactions are executed per second), and the
      minimum throughput in experimental tests can reach 101 tps.

TI  - A systematic review of the effects of cannabis on cognition in people with
      multiple sclerosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating disease which
      leads to sensory, motor, autonomic, and cognitive symptoms. Cannabis is a common 
      way for persons with MS (pwMS) to seek symptomatic therapy. Given the capacity
      for both cannabis and MS to cause cognitive impairment, it is important to
      determine whether there is any negative impact when the two co-occur. The
      objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the effects of cannabis and
      medicinal cannabinoid products on cognition in pwMS in order to provide guidance 
      to clinicians and enable them to make evidence-based recommendations regarding
      cannabis and cannabinoid products. METHODS: A systematic review was carried out
      searching common keyword combinations for cannabis and MS across five databases, 
      producing 840 unique articles, 18 of which were included in a qualitative
      synthesis. RESULTS: Aggregate data from existing studies to date highlight
      potential impairments from chronic whole-plant cannabis use in commonly affected 
      cognitive domains in multiple sclerosis, including attention and working memory, 
      and to a lesser extent, visual memory, verbal memory, and executive function.
      Results also suggest that in the short-term, medicinal cannabinoid preparations
      do not significantly impair cognition and may even ameliorate cognitive symptoms 
      in the context of obtrusive MS disease. The findings are limited by disparities
      in detail of cannabis use data reported across whole-plant cannabis publications.
      CONCLUSION: Existing literature on co-occurrence of cannabis use and MS lacks
      high quality evidence to recommend for or against cannabis and cannabinoid
      therapies for pwMS based on cognitive effects. Existing data suggest that
      cognition may be differentially impacted in pwMS depending on the type of
      product, the duration of use, and the indication. Future studies on whole-plant
      cannabis require comprehensive cannabis use data reporting including frequency,
      dosing, duration, and type of cannabis product. Future studies on medicinal
      cannabinoid products should be long-term to assess the effects of chronicity.

      Narrative Review.
PG  - 810912
LID - 10.3389/fnut.2021.810912 [doi]
AB  - A variety of eating behaviors among children have been associated with obesity
      risk and are thought to broadly reflect child appetite self-regulation (ASR).
      While ASR is thought to occur on cognitive, emotional, motivational, biological, 
      and behavioral levels, the inter-relatedness of ASR constructs as assessed by
      different methods/measures is not well-characterized. This narrative review
      describes the correspondence between different methods/measures of child ASR
      constructs as assessed by self-report questionnaires and/or observational tasks
      and their relationship to child standardized body mass index (BMIz). Research
      involving at least two different methods/measures is presented including
      observational tasks such as the Eating in the Absence of Hunger task,
      compensation trials, and eating rate, as well as various child eating behavior
      self-report questionnaires. Keyword searches in the PubMed and PsycINFO databases
      for articles published between 2000 and July 2021 identified 21,042 articles.
      Eighteen articles met the inclusion criteria and examined at least two of the
      targeted measures. Studies comparing questionnaire data with other questionnaire 
      data showed the most evidence of significant associations (r values ranging from 
      -0.45 to 0.49), whereas studies comparing questionnaires with observational tasks
      mostly showed weak (r values ranging from -0.17 to 0.19) or not significant
      associations, with only few studies finding moderate associations (r values
      ranging from -0.38 to 0.33). Studies comparing different observational tasks
      showed no significant associations. Overall, studies comparing self-report
      questionnaires showed the most correspondence, whereas those comparing
      observational tasks showed no correspondence. Studies across methods
      (questionnaires with tasks) showed less correspondence. Significant associations 
      were found between ASR constructs and child BMIz across five studies using
      self-report questionnaires and two studies using observational tasks. Future
      research is needed to clearly define the various ASR constructs, their expected
      correspondence, and the strength of that correspondence, as well as the relations
      between ASR constructs and child weight among youth with and without
      overweight/obesity.

AB  - Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a mosquito-borne disease caused by the Japanese
      encephalitis virus (JEV). The disease is mainly an epidemic in Asia and has been 
      studied for nearly 90 years. To evaluate the research trends of JE, 3,023 English
      publications between 1934 and 2020 were retrieved and analyzed from the Web of
      Science database using indicators for publication, country or territory,
      citation, journal, author and affiliation, keyword co-occurrence cluster, and
      strongest citation bursts detection. The results of the bibliometric analysis and
      the visualization tools show that the number of annual publications on JE has
      been increasing. JE has been continuously studied in the USA and also many Asian 
      countries, such as Japan, China, India, and South Korea; however, only a few
      publications have high citations. The main research groups of JE in the last 5
      years were in China, Japan, and the UK. The keyword co-occurrence analysis and
      the strongest citation bursts detection revealed that most studies focused on the
      pathogenic mechanism of JEV, control of outbreaks, and immunization with JE
      vaccine. The research maps on JE obtained by our analysis are expected to help
      researchers effectively explore the disease.

TI  - Timing of postoperative weightbearing in the treatment of traumatic chondral
      injuries of the knee in athletes - A systematic review of current concepts in
      clinical practice.
PG  - 1-8
LID - 10.1016/j.asmart.2022.01.001 [doi]
AB  - Background: Surgery aims to stimulate healing and enable a safe return to sport
      in athletes with symptomatic cartilage lesions of the knee. Timing of
      postoperative weightbearing is crucial, balancing a stimulation of the healing
      and avoiding reinjury.To explore current concepts of timing to partial and full
      weightbearing and rate of return to sport in athletes after articular cartilage
      surgery of the knee.Systematic Review of studies with level of evidence I-III.
      Methods: Four databases (Pubmed, Web of Science, Scopus and Embase) were searched
      using a predetermined keyword strategy. Two independent reviewers screened
      results according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Modified Coleman
      Methodology Score (mCMS) was used for the quality assessment. Results: 5294
      records were found. Data from ten studies was extracted after duplicate removal, 
      title and abstract screening and full-text evaluation. Eight of the ten studies
      included a detailed rehabilitation protocol, including 336 out of a total
      athletic population of 401. 62% began partial weightbearing (PWB) 1-2 weeks
      postoperatively, while 38% began within 3-4 weeks. The studies that had a later
      PWB all returned to full weightbearing (FWB) within 6-8 weeks. One study with
      early PWB returned to early FWB, while the other two returned 10-12 weeks
      postoperatively. "Return to Sport" (RTS) was the most common reported outcome
      measure, with most studies reporting RTS at 80% or higher. Conclusion: There is
      no clear evidence that the timing of weightbearing (WB) affects the outcome and
      return to sport in athletes after surgery for focal full-thickness cartilage
      lesions of the knee. On the other hand, there seems to be no adverse effects in
      adopting an early WB strategy, currently defined differently by different
      authors. Further studies directly comparing the timing of WB for specific
      surgical procedures in athletes and with relevant control groups is recommended. 
      There is a need for a consensus in regard to more exactly defining "early" vs
      "late" weightbearing in relation to a universal and precisely defined state of
      healing.

      Flow.
PG  - 7754961
LID - 10.1155/2022/7754961 [doi]
AB  - Mapping knowledge domain (MKD) is an important application in bibliometrics,
      which is a method of visually presenting and explaining newly developed
      interdisciplinary scientific fields using data mining, information analysis,
      scientific measurement, and graphic rendering. This study combines applied
      mathematics, visual analysis technology, information science, and scientometrics 
      to systematically analyze the development status, research distribution, and
      future trend of the heterogeneous traffic flow by using the MKD software tools
      VOSviewer and CiteSpace. Based on the MKD and Bibliometrics approaches, 4709
      articles have been studied, which were published by Science Citation Index
      Expanded (SCIE) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) from 2004 to 2021 in
      the field of heterogeneous traffic flows. Firstly, this paper presents the annual
      numbers of articles, origin countries, main research organizations, and groups as
      well as the source journals on heterogeneous traffic flow studies. Then,
      cocitation analysis is used to divide heterogeneous traffic flow into three main 
      research directions, which include "heterogeneous traffic flow model," "traffic
      flow capacity analysis," and "traffic flow stability analysis." The keyword
      cooccurrence analysis is applied to identify five dominant clusters: "modeling
      and optimization methods," "traffic flow characteristics analysis," "driving
      behavior analysis," "simulation experiment," and "policies and barriers."
      Finally, burst keywords were studied according to the publication date to present
      more clearly the change of research focus and direction over time.

TI  - Visualizing a Field of Research for the Coronavirus Replication in Humans with
      Knowledge Mapping: Evidence from Web of Science.
LID - 10.1007/s12539-022-00504-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The outbreak of COVID-19 sweeping the globe in 2020 has caused
      widespread fear and threatened global health security. Compared to SARS and MERS,
      COVID-19 also causes severe respiratory diseases and even fatal diseases but have
      many differences, such as the unidentified gene sequence and replication
      mechanism. From SARS to MERS, and then to COVID-19, coronaviruses have
      significant variations in host adaptation, virus evolution, infectivity, spread, 
      and pathogenicity due to its unique replication mechanism. METHODS: A field of
      research for the coronavirus replication in humans was visualized with a database
      covering 9177 kinds of literature in Web of Science from 2002 through October
      2021 to provide cognitive direction for the epidemic situation of virus
      infection. Knowledge Mapping by CiteSpace and Bibliometrix Package in R Software 
      was drawn to depict the underlying features of viral replication and changing
      trends of studies, with these analyses including co-citation, density
      visualization, keyword clustering, and time zone. RESULTS: The keyword
      frequencies of "replication," ''infection," and ''spike protein" repeatedly
      appeared in published papers. Coronavirus can promote or inhibit apoptosis,
      depending on the balance between viral protein and apoptotic factors. When the
      living environment of cells is irreversibly damaged by the virus, cells have to
      start the apoptosis mechanism to prevent the replication, transmission, and
      spread of the virus. The replication, assembly and transmission of coronavirus
      can inhibit cells from entering the apoptosis prematurely with the fusion of
      spike protein and cell receptor in human. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that 
      "viral infection," spike protein," and "mutation" might be future research
      hotspots on coronavirus replication in humans. The attention should be paid to
      the mutations of S protein and these mutants carrying mutations.

TI  - Evidence for Economic Evaluations of Athletic Trainer Services.
LID - 10.4085/1062-6050-0666.21 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Literature suggests athletic trainers (ATs) can help address health
      needs in a more affordable way across a variety of settings. We aimed to assess
      if AT services are cost-effective when compared to no AT services or services by 
      other health providers. DATA SOURCES: We performed a keyword search in 5
      databases: Medline (FirstSearch), PubMed, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus, and Google
      scholar. We also conducted a generic web search to identify any informal sources 
      that may meet the eligibility criteria. STUDY SELECTION: We used a comprehensive 
      list of terms to search economic evaluation studies on ATs. We included studies
      that met all the following criteria: economic evaluation studies on AT services; 
      original studies written in English; and published in the last 10
      years(2011-present). we excluded studies that examined either only cost or only
      benefit of AT services. DATA EXTRACTION: We extracted data using a predefined
      checklist that included major components of economic evaluation. We also
      extracted data regarding athletic training practice setting. RESULTS: We
      extracted 5 articles in our review, most of which supported the use of AT
      services as economically viable. The practice settings studied in the articles
      included two high school settings, two military settings, and a community
      outreach program that included several practice settings. Only one of the studies
      used standard economic evaluation methodology and took insurance status into
      account. CONCLUSION: Our review shows that AT services can be a cost-effective
      option for addressing health care needs. However, the literature remains sparse
      and there was an overall lack of consistency in outcome measures, analytical
      methods, and reporting practices, which reduced the comparability across studies.
      Future studies on this topic should address these limitations, which will provide
      critical economic evidence to inform decision making on investing in AT services 
      across various settings.

AB  - Nowadays the agrifood system requires major transformations aimed at promoting
      sustainability, reducing waste and stimulating a change toward healthy
      sustainable diets. The scientific literature on the transition to sustainable
      food models continues to develop rapidly and there is an urgent need to
      systematize its knowledge structure and thus make future research more vigorous. 
      Recently, several studies have focused on certain aspects of supply chain, such
      as traceability or decision-making frameworks, but a systematic review of the
      role of sustainability within the agrifood supply has never been carried out.
      Through a bibliometric analysis combined with network and content analyses, the
      present study is aimed at identifying homogeneous areas in the field of agrifood 
      supply chains, investigating the role of innovation technology in the transition 
      to sustainability. The bibliometric results showed that sustainable agrifood
      supply chains are experiencing an evolving positive trend and represent a
      challenging research topic which is capturing the attention of scholars. From the
      network and overlay visualization of keyword co-occurrences four different
      research clusters were identified and the blockchain emerged as central topic in 
      the field of food security and safety. The content analysis highlighted greater
      attention to the environmental pillar, compared to the economic and social
      pillars of the sustainability paradigm. A lack of studies was also observed on
      the post-consumption phase of the agrifood supply chain, which could represent a 
      research gap to be fulfilled in the light of circular economy.

TI  - The national burden of scabies in Germany: a population-based approach using
      Internet search engine data.
LID - 10.1007/s15010-022-01763-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Scabies is a World Health Organization-defined neglected tropical
      disease and a growing public health issue worldwide. It is difficult to obtain
      reliable data on prevalence due to the lack of standardized tests. The aim of
      this study was to assess scabies online search behavior in Germany to identify
      local differences using Google search volume. METHODS: Google Ads Keyword Planner
      was used to investigate the scabies-related search volume for Germany as a whole,
      its 16 federal states, and 15 large cities for the period from January 2016 to
      December 2019. The identified search terms were qualitatively categorized and
      critically analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 572 keywords with an overall search
      volume of 11,414,180 searches regarding scabies were identified in Germany. The
      number of searches was higher in winter than in summer, with a national peak in
      March 2018. Around 30.6% of the searches regarding scabies therapy (n = 978,420) 
      were related to home remedies. Regarding body localization, most searches focused
      on the whole body (n = 109,050), followed by head (n = 89,360) and the genital
      area (n = 28,640). CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of Google search data provides an
      overview of the populations' interest regarding scabies. The analysis can detect 
      local peaks and assess the relevance of scabies at individual localizations of
      the body. The study highlighted current possible shortcomings in the therapy of
      scabies. It also underlined the importance of improving awareness regarding
      scabies so that affected individuals can consult a doctor earlier for treatment.

TI  - Mobile Phone Apps for Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Prevention and
      Response: Systematic Search on App Stores.
PG  - e28959
LID - 10.2196/28959 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since the 2008 advent of the smartphone, more than 180 billion copies
      of apps have been downloaded from Apple App Store, with more than 2.6 million
      apps available for Android and 2.2 million apps available for iOS. Many violence 
      prevention and response apps have been developed as part of this app
      proliferation. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the prevalence and quality 
      of freely available mobile phone apps targeting intimate partner violence (IPV)
      and sexual violence (SV) prevention and response. METHODS: We conducted a
      systematic search of violence prevention and response mobile phone apps freely
      available in Apple App Store (iOS; March 2016) and Google Play Store (Android;
      July 2016). Search terms included violence prevention, sexual assault, domestic
      violence, intimate partner violence, sexual violence, forensic nursing, wife
      abuse, and rape. Apps were included for review if they were freely available,
      were available in English, and had a primary purpose of prevention of or response
      to SV or IPV regardless of app target end users. RESULTS: Using the Mobile
      Application Rating Scale (MARS), we evaluated a total of 132 unique apps. The
      majority of included apps had a primary purpose of sharing information or
      resources. Included apps were of low-to-moderate quality, with the overall
      subjective quality mean for the reviewed apps being 2.65 (95% CI 2.58-2.72).
      Quality scores for each of the 5 MARS categories ranged from 2.80 (engagement) to
      4.75 (functionality). An incidental but important finding of our review was the
      difficulty in searching for apps and the plethora of nonrelated apps that appear 
      when searching for keywords such as "rape" and "domestic violence" that may be
      harmful to people seeking help. CONCLUSIONS: Although there are a variety of
      mobile apps available designed to provide information or other services related
      to SV and IPV, they range greatly in quality. They are also challenging to find, 
      given the current infrastructure of app store searches, keyword prioritization,
      and highlighting based on user rating. It is important for providers to be aware 
      of these resources and be knowledgeable about how to review and recommend mobile 
      phone apps to patients, when appropriate.

TI  - TextRank Keyword Extraction Algorithm Using Word Vector Clustering Based on Rough
      Data-Deduction.
PG  - 5649994
LID - 10.1155/2022/5649994 [doi]
AB  - When TextRank algorithm based on graph model constructs graph associative edges, 
      the co-occurrence window rules only consider the relationships between local
      terms. Using the information in the document itself is limited. In order to solve
      the above problems, an improved TextRank keyword extraction algorithm based on
      rough data reasoning combined with word vector clustering, RDD-WRank, was
      proposed. Firstly, the algorithm uses rough data reasoning to mine the
      association between candidate keywords, expands the search scope, and makes the
      results more comprehensive. Then, based on Wikipedia online open knowledge base, 
      word embedding technology is used to integrate Word2Vec into the improved
      algorithm, and the word vector of TextRank lexical graph nodes is clustered to
      adjust the voting importance of nodes in the cluster. Compared with the
      traditional TextRank algorithm and the Word2Vec algorithm combined with TextRank,
      the experimental results show that the improved algorithm has significantly
      improved the extraction accuracy, which proves that the idea of using rough data 
      reasoning can effectively improve the performance of the algorithm to extract
      keywords.

TI  - Analysis of agricultural exports based on deep learning and text mining.
PG  - 1-17
LID - 10.1007/s11227-021-04238-w [doi]
AB  - Agricultural exports are an important source of economic profit for many
      countries. Accurate predictions of a country's agricultural exports month on
      month are key to understanding a country's domestic use and export figures and
      facilitate advance planning of export, import, and domestic use figures and the
      resulting necessary adjustments of production and marketing. This study proposes 
      a novel method for predicting the rise and fall of agricultural exports, called
      agricultural exports time series-long short-term memory (AETS-LSTM). The method
      applies Jieba word segmentation and Word2Vec to train word vectors and uses
      TF-IDF and word cloud to learn news-related keywords and finally obtain keyword
      vectors. This research explores whether the purchasing managers' index (PMI) of
      each industry can effectively use the AETS-LSTM model to predict the rise and
      fall of agricultural exports. Research results show that the inclusion of keyword
      vectors in the PMI values of the finance and insurance industries has a relative 
      impact on the prediction of the rise and fall of agricultural exports, which can 
      improve the prediction accuracy for the rise and fall of agricultural exports by 
      82.61%. The proposed method achieves improved prediction ability for the
      chemical/biological/medical, transportation equipment, wholesale, finance and
      insurance, food and textiles, basic materials, education/professional,
      science/technical, information/communications/broadcasting, transportation and
      storage, retail, and electrical and machinery equipment categories, while its
      performance for the electrical and optical categories shows improved prediction
      by combining keyword vectors, and its accuracy for the accommodation and food
      service, and construction and real estate industries remained unchanged.
      Therefore, the proposed method offers improved prediction capacity for
      agricultural exports month on month, allowing agribusiness operators and policy
      makers to evaluate and adjust domestic and foreign production and sales.

AB  - Background: Lung cancer is currently the most commonly diagnosed malignant tumor 
      worldwide. Exploring ways to improve the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis has
      important clinical significance. Radiomics transforms images into
      high-dimensional data, and uses deep learning and artificial intelligence to
      improve the accuracy and efficiency of disease diagnosis. There is an increasing 
      amount of research on radiomics in the diagnosis of lung cancer. This study
      analyzes the relevant literature in the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-E)
      database to understand the current research status and future development
      direction of lung cancer radiomics. Methods: This study is based on the SCI-E
      database. The first search formula is topic = Lung cancer OR Lung neoplasms (#1),
      the second search formula is topic = Radiomics (#2), and the third search formula
      is #1 and #2, that is, literature that meets both the first and second search
      results. CiteSpace software was used to analyze lung cancer radiomics from the
      annual distribution of articles, countries, institutions, journals, and authors
      and keywords. HistCite software was used to visualize the citation chronology of 
      the lung cancer radiomics literature, and Pajek software was used to analyze the 
      main path of the citation chronology. Results: There were a total of 749
      publications, of which most were original articles (529, 70.63%) and reviews
      (109, 14.55%). The citation frequency is 21,676 times, the h-index is 66, and the
      average number of citations per publication is 28.94. The research mainly comes
      from the United States of America, China and other countries. The research
      institutions are mainly medical centers such as Moffitt Cancer Center, Maastricht
      University and Harvard Medical School. The authors are also mainly from these
      institutions. The literature was published in many related journals, mainly
      imaging and oncology journals. Keyword analysis shows that in recent years,
      research has focused on deep learning and artificial intelligence. Conclusions:
      The field of lung cancer radiomics is developing rapidly, and the main focuses of
      research are deep learning and artificial intelligence.

AB  - To gain insight into the trend of bacterial nanocellulose research, a
      bibliometric analysis was performed using the Science Citation Index Expanded
      database from 2005 to 2020. The study concentrated on the publication's
      performance in terms of annual outputs and citations, mainstream journals,
      categories of the Web of Sciences, leading countries, prominent institutions, and
      trends in research. Current research priorities and future trends were analyzed
      after summarizing the most commonly used keywords extracted from words in the
      paper title analysis, authors' keyword analysis, and KeyWords Plus. The findings 
      revealed that the annual output in the form of scholarly articles on bacterial
      nanocellulose research steadily increased during the first quartile of the study 
      period, followed by a very rapid increase in the last five-years of the study.
      Increasing mechanical strength would remain the main future focus of bacterial
      nanocellulose research to create its scope in different field of applications.

TI  - Determination of Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Vaccine Hesitancy Using a
      Systematic Review Approach Based on the Scientific Articles in PubMed Database.
PG  - 70-84
LID - 10.5152/TurkThoracJ.2022.21082 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Publications on vaccine hesitancy and the novel coronavirus disease
      2019 in the scientific literature are increasing every day. An examination of
      their content will help to eliminate the existing negativity related to vaccine
      hesitancy through scientific methods. Hence, a systematic approach to the
      prevention of vaccine hesitancy worldwide can be developed. This article aims to 
      survey how vaccine hesitancy is addressed in the PubMed articles about "vaccine
      hesitancy" over the novel coronavirus disease, for which the MeSH criteria have
      been published; to understand their recommendations for the prevention of vaccine
      hesitancy; to evaluate any related research described as "cross-sectional,"
      "case-control," and "cohort" according to Strengthening the Reporting of
      Observational Studies in Epidemiology criteria; and to contribute to the current 
      literature on the subject. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study is planned to use a
      systematic review format and STROBE checklist was used to evaluate the articles
      accessed from PubMed database. Microsoft Excel was used as the data calculation
      tool. RESULTS: Sixty-five (81.3%) of the 80 articles investigated in the scope of
      this study mention "vaccine." While 64 articles (80%) discuss the determination
      of vaccine hesitancy, 57 (71.3%) articles address its prevention. The keyword
      "COVID-19" is used in 61 articles (79.2%). The second most frequently used
      keyword is "vaccine hesitancy" (n = 37, 48.1%), followed by "vaccine" (n = 25,
      32.5%). Twenty-nine (48%) of the reviewed articles originate from the WHO
      American Continents. The second most represented region of research is the
      European Region (n = 21, 35%), followed by the South East Asian Region (n = 5,
      8%). CONCLUSION: This study illustrates the recent situation for the coronavirus 
      disease 2019 vaccine and reveals the presence of a vaccine hesitancy. Vaccine
      hesitancy is a risk factor that could prevent herd immunity. The systematic
      review of scientific articles should continue with improvements in order to
      tackle the problem as exemplified by the present study. Other checklists as well 
      as STROBE checklist are recommended to be used in similar studies to have more
      objective conclusions.

TI  - A novel statistical method predicts mutability of the genomic segments of the
      SARS-CoV-2 virus.
PG  - e1
LID - 10.1017/qrd.2021.13 [doi]
AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 virus has made the largest pandemic of the 21st century, with
      hundreds of millions of cases and tens of millions of fatalities. Scientists all 
      around the world are racing to develop vaccines and new pharmaceuticals to
      overcome the pandemic and offer effective treatments for COVID-19 disease.
      Consequently, there is an essential need to better understand how the
      pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is affected by viral mutations and to determine the
      conserved segments in the viral genome that can serve as stable targets for novel
      therapeutics. Here, we introduce a text-mining method to estimate the mutability 
      of genomic segments directly from a reference (ancestral) whole genome sequence. 
      The method relies on calculating the importance of genomic segments based on
      their spatial distribution and frequency over the whole genome. To validate our
      approach, we perform a large-scale analysis of the viral mutations in nearly
      80,000 publicly available SARS-CoV-2 predecessor whole genome sequences and show 
      that these results are highly correlated with the segments predicted by the
      statistical method used for keyword detection. Importantly, these correlations
      are found to hold at the codon and gene levels, as well as for gene coding
      regions. Using the text-mining method, we further identify codon sequences that
      are potential candidates for siRNA-based antiviral drugs. Significantly, one of
      the candidates identified in this work corresponds to the first seven codons of
      an epitope of the spike glycoprotein, which is the only SARS-CoV-2 immunogenic
      peptide without a match to a human protein.

TI  - Web-Based Research Trends on Child and Adolescent Cancer Survivors Over the Last 
      5 Years: Text Network Analysis and Topic Modeling Study.
PG  - e32309
LID - 10.2196/32309 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Being diagnosed with cancer during childhood or adolescence can
      disrupt important periods in an individual's physical, psychosocial, and
      spiritual development and potentially reduce the quality of life (QOL) after
      treatment. Research is urgently required to improve the QOL for child and
      adolescent cancer survivors, and it is necessary to analyze the trends in prior
      research reported in international academic journals to identify knowledge
      structures. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the main keywords based on
      network centrality, subgroups (clusters) of keyword networks by using a cohesion 
      analysis method, and the main theme of child and adolescent cancer
      survivor-related research abstracts through topic modeling. This study also aims 
      to label the subgroups by comparing the results of the cohesion and topic
      modeling. METHODS: A text network analysis method and topic modeling were used to
      explore the main trends in child and adolescent cancer survivor research by
      structuring a network of keyword (semantic morphemes) co-occurrence in the
      abstracts of articles published in 5 major web-based databases from 2016 to 2020.
      A total of 1677 child and adolescent cancer survivor-related studies were used
      for data analyses. Data selection, processing, and analyses were also conducted. 
      RESULTS: The top 5 keywords in terms of degree and eigenvector centrality were
      risk, control interval, radiation, childhood cancer treatment, and diagnosis. Of 
      the 1677 studies used for data analyses, cluster 1 included 780 (46.51%)
      documents under risk management, cluster 2 contained 557 (33.21%) articles under 
      health-related QOL and supportive care, and cluster 3 consisted of 340 (20.27%)
      studies under cancer treatment and complications. CONCLUSIONS: This study is
      significant in that it confirms the knowledge structure based on the main
      keywords and cross-disciplinary trends in child and adolescent cancer survivor
      research published in the last 5 years worldwide. The primary goal of child and
      adolescent cancer survivor research is to prevent and manage the various aspects 
      of the problems encountered during the transition to a normal life and to improve
      the overall QOL. To this end, it is necessary to further revitalize the study of 
      the multidisciplinary team approach for the promotion of age-specific health
      behaviors and the development of intervention strategies with increased
      feasibility for child and adolescent cancer survivors.

      of approaches and mechanisms.

AB  - Constructed wetlands (CWs) are increasingly employed to remediate heavy metal and
      metalloid (HMM)-polluted water. However, the disadvantages of HMM removal by
      conventional CWs (without enhancement), such as an unstable and unpredictable
      removal efficiency, hinder the reliability of this technology. The objective of
      this study was to review research on enhanced CWs for HMM removal. In particular,
      we performed a bibliometric analysis to evaluate research trends, critical
      literature, and keyword evolution in recent years. Subsequently, we reviewed
      various enhanced approaches for the application of CWs for the removal of HMMs,
      including the use of improved substrates, aquatic macrophytes, microorganisms,
      bioelectrochemical coupling systems, hybrid CW, external additives, and operation
      parameters. Furthermore, the main mechanisms underlying HMM removal by these
      approaches are summarized. Our review clearly reveals that research on the
      remediation of HMM-polluted water via CW technology is receiving increased
      attention, with no apparent trends in topics. The selection of appropriate
      enhanced approaches or operation parameters as well as methodological
      improvements should be based on the dominant environmental conditions of the CW
      column and removal mechanisms for the targeted HMMs. Based on the established
      literature, several suggestions are proposed to guide the optimization of the
      design and operation of efficient CWs for the treatment of HMM-polluted water.

TI  - Barriers and facilitators to implementation of direct fruit and vegetables
      provision interventions in kindergartens and schools: a qualitative systematic
      review applying the consolidated framework for implementation research (CFIR).
PG  - 11
LID - 10.1186/s12966-022-01246-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although children's intake of fruit and vegetables has seen a recent 
      rise, almost half of adolescents do not eat even one piece of fruit or vegetables
      per day. One way to address this problem is through interventions that provide
      fruit and vegetables directly to children in kindergartens and schools. For such 
      interventions to meet their intended goals, what is important to consider in
      addition to impact is implementation. Our objective is to systematically review
      qualitative results reporting on the determinants (barriers and facilitators) to 
      implementation of interventions that entail direct provision of fruit and
      vegetables in kindergarten and school settings and conduct a framework analysis
      of those results using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research
      (CFIR). METHODS: A systematic search was designed and run in November 2019 for:
      MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), PsychINFO (Ovid), ERIC (Ovid), Cochrane Library
      Reviews and Cochrane Library Trials. A keyword search of the journal
      Implementation Science was completed. Screening of titles and abstracts (n =
      5427) and full texts (n = 227), led to 14 included articles. Coding and analysis 
      were done using the framework method and CFIR. RESULTS: The following CFIR
      constructs were found relevant: 1) intervention characteristics domain: 'design
      quality and packaging', 'adaptability' 'cost'; 2) outer setting:
      'cosmopolitanism', 'external policy and incentives' 'patients' needs and
      resources'; 3) inner setting: 'implementation climate', 'readiness for
      implementation' and 'structural characteristics'; 4) characteristics of
      individuals: 'individual stage of change', 'knowledge and beliefs about the
      intervention' 5) process: 'engaging', 'executing' and 'reflecting and
      evaluating'. The review stresses the dual role of parents as both supporting the 
      implementation and targets of the intervention, which could have implications for
      the design and implementation of future fruit and vegetables interventions.
      Positive child perceptions of the value of the intervention and perceived
      behavior change due to the intervention were reported as relevant facilitators to
      implementation across several studies, and should be taken into consideration in 
      future design efforts. CONCLUSIONS: CFIR offers a systematic way to identify and 
      organize barriers and facilitators to implementation of interventions in the
      kindergarten and school setting. Revisions are encouraged to allow adequate space
      for perceptions of various implementation actors and the target group. PROSPERO

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyse characteristics of literature related to dental research
      and education published in a single medical journal, The Journal of Pakistan
      Medical Association. METHODS: The bibliometric study was conducted at the Sindh
      Institute of Oral Health Sciences, Jinnah Sindh Medical University from March
      till May 2020, and comprised electronic and hand search of scientific literature 
      relevant to dentistry published in the Journal of Pakistan Medical Association
      from the first issue published in 1953 till March 2020. The selected articles
      were analysed for year of publication, field of study, type of article, institute
      and country of first author, number of authors and citation count. Keyword
      mapping was also carried out. Data was analysed using SPSS 19. RESULTS: Of the
      159 articles identified, 117(73.6%) were contributed from Pakistan. The most
      common specialties were Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and Epidemiology with
      20(12.6%) articles each, followed by Operative Dentistry and Endodontics
      19(11.9%). Majority of articles were Original / Research 87(54.7%). The highest
      number of articles were published in 2019 26(16.35%). The Aga Khan University,
      contributed the most publications 30(18.9%), followed by Dow University of Health
      Sciences, 11(6.9%). Majority of the articles were contributed by three authors
      48(38.4%). The top cited article was found to have 113 citations, followed by
      articles with 103 and 91 citations. CONCLUSIONS: The contribution of scientific
      papers related to dentistry and dental education in the Journal of Pakistan
      Medical Association was significant. With growth of dentistry as a discipline
      along with a parallel increase in the publication of dental research papers, it
      is imperative that a dedicated indexed journal for dental research be commenced.

      Visualization Analysis via CiteSpace.
PG  - 797902
LID - 10.3389/fmolb.2021.797902 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To analyze the research hot spots and frontiers of molecular
      mechanisms of exercise on cancer via CiteSpace. Method: Related publications in
      the Web of Science Core Collection Science Citation Index Expanded were retrieved
      from inception to November 27th, 2021. Then we used CiteSpace to generate network
      maps and identify top authors, institutions, countries, keywords, co-cited
      authors, journals, references and research trends. Results: A total of 1,130
      related publications were retrieved. The most productive author and journal were 
      Lee W Jones and PLOS ONE. Hanahan D and Warburg O were the most cited authors.
      Fudan University and Shanghai Jiao Tong University were the leading institutions,
      while China was the leading country. Top-cited authors and references generally
      focused on the epidemiology and hallmarks of cancer. Top five keywords with both 
      high frequency and high betweenness centrality were breast cancer, aerobic
      glycolysis, oxidative stress, gene expression, skeletal muscle. Keyword "warburg 
      effect" ranked first with the highest citation burst, while "inflammation",
      "hepatocellular carcinoma", "epithelial mesenchymal transition", and "adipose
      tissue" were emerging research foci. Conclusion: This study analyzed the research
      hot spots and frontiers of molecular mechanisms of exercise on cancer via
      CiteSpace. Based on the results, altered metabolism (aerobic glycolysis, insulin 
      resistance, myokines), oxidative stress, gene expression and apoptosis were
      hot-research mechanisms of exercise on cancer. Emerging research foci of
      mechanisms were generally around inflammation, epithelial mesenchymal transition 
      and adipokines. In addition, future studies could carry in-depth research of
      interactions between different mechanisms and try to elucidate the recommended
      doses and intensities of exercise for cancer, especially in breast, colorectal,
      prostate cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma.

LID - 10.1016/j.bja.2021.11.038 [doi]
AB  - Literature focused on quantifying or reducing patient harm in anaesthesia uses a 
      variety of labels and definitions to represent patient safety-related events,
      such as 'medication errors', 'adverse events', and 'critical incidents'. This
      review extracts and compares definitions of patient safety-related terminology in
      anaesthesia to examine the scope of this variability and inconsistencies. A
      structured review was performed in which 36 of the 769 articles reviewed met the 
      inclusion criteria. Similar terms were grouped into six categories by
      similarities in keyword choice (Adverse Event, Critical Incident, Medication
      Error, Error, Near Miss, and Harm) and their definitions were broken down into
      three base components to allow for comparison. Our analysis found that the
      Medication Error category, which encompasses the greatest number of terms, had
      widely variant definitions which represent fundamentally different concepts.
      Definitions of terms within the other categories consistently represented
      relatively similar concepts, though key variations in wording remain. This
      inconsistency in terminology can lead to problems with synthesising,
      interpreting, and overall sensemaking in relation to anaesthesia medication
      safety. Guidance towards how 'medication errors' should be defined is provided,
      yet a definition will have little impact on the future of patient safety without 
      organisations and journals taking the lead to promote, publish, and standardise
      definitions.

TI  - The Top 100 Most-Cited Papers in Erosive Tooth Wear: A Bibliometric Analysis.
LID - 10.1159/000521877 [doi]
AB  - Citation rates can be used as an indicator of the influence and relevance of
      scientific papers. The present study analyzed the 100 most-cited articles related
      to erosive tooth wear (ETW). The top 100 most-cited papers focusing on ETW topics
      were collected from the Web of Science database on November 11th, 2020. The
      following bibliometric data were extracted from papers: title, authorship,
      institutions, countries, number of citations, year of publication, journal title,
      study design, topic, and keywords. Scopus and Google Scholar were searched to
      compare the number of citations. The VOSviewer software was used to generate
      collaborative network maps for the authors and keywords. The number of citations 
      of the 100 most-cited papers ranged from 71 to 330 (average: 97.44). The papers
      were published between 1949 and 2015. Caries Research (28%) and The Journal of
      Dentistry (16%) presented the majority of papers. Laboratorial (44%) and
      observational studies (33%) were the most common study designs. The most studied 
      topics were epidemiology (31%) and the erosive potential of substances [drinks,
      foods, or medicines] (22%). The countries with the highest number of most-cited
      papers were England (32%), Germany (18%), and Switzerland (10%). The University
      of Bern was the institution with the most papers (10%). Lussi A was the author
      with the highest number of papers in the top 100 (14%). The most common keyword
      was "dental erosion" with 64 occurrences. The top 100 most-cited papers related
      to ETW were composed mainly of laboratorial and observational studies focusing on
      epidemiology and the erosive potential of substances. .

AB  - Telemedicine modalities for patient care have seen significant global uptake
      during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to bibliometrically evaluate the
      evolution and current landscape of telemedicine literature in Canada. The Scopus 
      database was searched to identify telemedicine publications for which the first
      or last author had a Canadian institutional affiliation. Study selection and data
      abstraction were conducted by two pairs of independent reviewers. Between 1976
      and January 2021, 810 of 3620 retrieved citations were telemedicine publications 
      originating from Canada, including 29 randomized controlled trials and 6
      systematic reviews. The annual publication output increased substantially from
      1/year in 1976 to 80/year in 2020. Based on author keyword analysis, the most
      frequently investigated disciplines or disease entities were primary care,
      COVID-19, telepsychiatry, heart failure, and mental health. The insights this
      study provides will aid scientists, policymakers, and other stakeholders in
      identifying opportunities for future investigation and clinical application.

PG  - 15589447211043187
LID - 10.1177/15589447211043187 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment of pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis (FTS) historically
      involved surgical debridement supplemented with antibiotic therapy. No consensus 
      exists on either: (1) the treatment algorithm for this infection; or (2) the
      clinical definition of "early" FTS. We performed a retrospective study to clarify
      indications for nonoperative management. METHODS: We identified 40 patients with 
      a diagnosis of FTS using Current Procedural Terminology and International
      Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, codes and a keyword search from an
      electronic medical record between 2011 and 2019. Patients underwent either
      surgical management (SG) (n = 20) or early antibiotics only (EAG) (n = 20). The
      surgical group was divided into patients with intraoperative purulence within the
      tendon sheath (PU) and those without purulence (NP). RESULTS: The number of
      Kanavel signs and duration of days of symptoms were significantly greater in SG
      compared with EAG. Subgroup analysis of SG showed a greater number of days of
      symptoms in the NP group when compared with the PU group. No statistical
      significance was found with respect to age, smoking, or specific individual
      Kanavel signs between SG and EAG. CONCLUSIONS: Both duration of symptoms and
      number of Kanavel signs should be considered in suspected early FTS. Patients
      with shorter duration of symptoms and fewer Kanavel signs were treated
      successfully with antibiotics alone. Operatively confirmed FTS presented more
      acutely with fewer days of symptoms and a higher number of Kanavel signs.
      Patients with subacute presentations may represent inflammatory conditions and
      hand infections other than FTS.

TI  - Study of virtual reality for mild cognitive impairment: A bibliometric analysis
      using CiteSpace.
PG  - 129-136
LID - 10.1016/j.ijnss.2021.12.007 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: Non-invasive and low-cost virtual reality (VR) technology is
      important for early evaluation and intervention in mild cognitive impairment
      (MCI). This study aimed to demonstrate the current status of overseas and
      domestic research as well as the focus and frontier of VR technology among
      individuals with MCI through a bibliometric analysis. Methods: Studies from the
      core collection of Web of Science between 1995 and 2020 were used; furthermore,
      CiteSpace 5.7 R3 was utilized to analyse information on authors/cited authors,
      keywords, burst words, and cited references. Results: In total, 230 publications 
      were identified. Most studies were published in the USA (45 publications) and
      Italy (41 publications), where Guiseppe Riva ranks first (14 publications), and
      Tarnanas I is the author with the highest centrality (0.44). The hot topics in VR
      applications in the MCI population are 'physical activity,' 'people,'
      'single-blind,' 'disease,' 'walking,' 'technology,' 'working memory,' and 'risk' 
      in recent years. The keyword 'mild cognitive impairment' has attracted extensive 
      attention since 2012, showing the strongest citation outbreak (8.28). The
      clustering results of the literature show the research types and emerging trends,
      including 'exergame,' 'serious games,' 'spatial navigation,' 'activities of daily
      living,' 'exercise,' 'enriched environment' and 'wayfinding.' Conclusions:
      Cognitive assessment and nonpharmacological intervention research on patients
      with MCI have become the focus of dementia prevention in recent years. Virtual
      technology, combined with traditional methods such as exercise therapy, provides 
      new ideas for innovative cognitive evaluation and cognitive intervention.

TI  - Factitial dermatitis in the hospital setting.
LID - 10.1007/s00403-022-02322-6 [doi]
AB  - Factitial Dermatitis (FD) is a notoriously difficult disease to diagnose, as
      patients produce self-induced cutaneous lesions and provide an inadequate or
      inaccurate history. We performed a cross-sectional study, querying an inpatient
      consultation database of all patients admitted to the Ohio State University
      Wexner Medical Center from 2012 to 2017 with a dermatologic ICD as a discharge
      diagnosis. Our exhaustive keyword search produced 189 candidates. Consult notes
      were thoroughly examined, and 32 patients were found to meet case definition of
      FD. Our analysis of this cohort revealed a significantly greater proportion of
      cases in the female population. Lesions were more often found to involve the skin
      on the upper extremities. Isolated secondary skin changes such as erosions,
      ulcers and excoriations in the absence primary morphologies were also significant
      in our cohort. As FD is difficult to identify, further understanding of its
      presentation pattern will decrease time to diagnosis and improve both hospital
      resource allocation and patient care.

TI  - Systematic review and meta-analysis of the 2010 ASGE non-invasive predictors of
      choledocholithiasis and comparison to the 2019 ASGE predictors.
LID - 10.1007/s12328-021-01575-4 [doi]
AB  - In 2019, the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) guideline on 
      the endoscopic management of choledocholithiasis modified the individual
      predictors of choledocholithiasis proposed in the widely referenced 2010
      guideline to improve predictive performance. Nevertheless, the primary
      literature, especially for the 2019 iteration, is limited. We performed a
      systematic review with meta-analysis to examine the diagnostic performance of the
      2010, and where possible the 2019, predictors. PROSPERO protocol CRD42020194226. 
      A comprehensive literature search from 2001 to 2020 was performed to identify
      studies on the diagnostic performance of any of the 2010 and 2019 ASGE
      choledocholithiasis predictors. Identified studies underwent keyword screening,
      abstract review, and full-text review. The primary outcomes included multivariate
      odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals for each criterion. Secondary
      outcomes were reported sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative
      predictive value. A total of 20 studies met inclusion criteria. Based on reported
      ORs, of the 2010 guideline "very strong" predictors, ultrasound with stone had
      the strongest performance. Of the "strong" predictors, CBD > 6 mm demonstrated
      the strongest performance. "Moderate" predictors had inconsistent and/or weak
      performance; moreover, all studies reported gallstone pancreatitis as
      non-predictive of choledocholithiasis. Only one study examined the new predictor 
      (bilirubin > 4 mg/dL and CBD > 6 mm) proposed in the 2019 guideline. Based on
      this review, aside from CBD stone on ultrasound, there is discordance between the
      proposed strength of 2010 choledocholithiasis predictors and their published
      diagnostic performance. The 2019 guideline appears to do away with the weakest
      2010 predictors.

TI  - Global research Trends in Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors: A Co-Word and Visualized
      Study.
LID - 10.2196/34548 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tyrosinase inhibitors (TKIs) have achieved revolutionary results in
      the treatment of a wide range of tumors, which have brought out a lot of
      literature in this field every year. And some reviews provide a great value for
      us to understand TKIs. However, there is a lack of studies on the knowledge
      structure, bibliometric analysis, and visualized results in TKIs research.
      OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to investigate the knowledge structure, hotspots, and 
      trends of evolution of the TKIs research by co-word analysis and literature
      visualization and help researchers in this field to gain a comprehensive
      understanding of the current status and trends. METHODS: We obtained all academic
      papers about TKIs published in 2016-2020 from the Web of Science. Based on
      counting keywords from those papers, we generated the co-word networks by
      extracting the co-occurrence relationships between keywords, and segmented
      communities to identify the sub-directions of TKIs research by calculating the
      network metrics of the overall and local networks. We also mapped the association
      network topology, including the network within and between TKIs sub-directions,
      to reveal the association and structure among varied sub-directions. Furthermore,
      we detected keyword bursts by combining their burst weights and durations to
      reveal changes in the focus of TKIs research. Finally, evolution venation and
      strategic diagram were generated to reveal the trends of TKIs research. RESULTS: 
      We obtained 6,782 unique words (total frequency 26,175) from 5,584 paper
      captions. Finally, 296 high-frequency words were selected with a threshold of 10 
      after discussion, the total frequency of which accounted for 65.41%. The analysis
      of burst disciplines revealed a variable number of burst words of TKIs research
      every year, especially in 2019 and 2020, such as HER2, Pyrotinib, Next-generation
      Sequencing, Immunotherapy, ALK-TKI, ALK Rearrangement, etc. By network
      calculation, the TKIs co-word network was divided into six communities:
      C1-Non-small Cell Lung Cancer, C2-Targeted Therapy, C3-Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, 
      C4-HER2, C5-Pharmacokinetics, and C6-ALK. The venation diagram revealed several
      clear and continuous evolution trends, such as Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
      venation, Chronic Myeloid Leukemia venation, Renal Cell Carcinoma venation,
      Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia venation, etc. In the strategic diagram,
      C1-Non-small Cell Lung Cancer was the core direction located in the first
      quadrant, C2-Targeted Therapy was exactly at the junction of the first and fourth
      quadrants that meant C2 was developing, and C3-Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, C4-HER2,
      and C5-Pharmacokinetics were all immature that all located in the third quadrant.
      CONCLUSIONS: Using co-word analysis and literature visualization, we revealed the
      hotspots, knowledge structure, and trends of evolution of TKIs research during
      2016-2020. TKIs research mainly focused on targeted therapies against varied
      tumors, particularly against NSCLC. The attention on CML and pharmacokinetics was
      gradually decreasing, but the heat of HER2 and ALK was rapidly increasing. TKIs
      research had shown a clear development path: TKIs research was disease-focused
      and revolved around "gene targets/targeted drugs/resistance mechanisms". Our
      outcomes will provide sound and effective support to researchers, funders,
      policymakers, and clinicians. CLINICALTRIAL:

TI  - Cost Comparison From a Patient Perspective for Intracranial Stereotactic
      Radiation Therapy.
PG  - 100816
LID - 10.1016/j.adro.2021.100816 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Historically, opaque health care pricing in the US has prevented
      patients from identifying opportunities to lower costs. Attempting to promote
      price transparency, the US government recently mandated that hospitals publish
      prices for all services in a document called a chargemaster. Patients often
      travel to tertiary centers for intracranial stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT),
      but cost comparison is complicated by multiple delivery systems and fractionation
      schemes. We hypothesized that prices published in chargemasters vary widely
      between SRT techniques and institutions. Methods and Materials: We obtained
      chargemasters published online by National Cancer Institute-designated clinical
      centers. Technical charges for Gamma Knife single-fraction stereotactic
      radiosurgery (GK), single-fraction linear-accelerator stereotactic radiation
      surgery (SRS), and 3-fraction fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy (FSRT) 
      were obtained from chargemasters by billing code and keyword searches. Prices
      were adjusted by the Medicare geographic cost price index (GPCI). Pairwise
      comparisons were conducted to compare prices between modalities and geographic
      regions. Relationships with cost index were examined using Spearman correlations,
      as was the price interrelationship between modalities across institutions.
      Results: Of 62 chargemasters obtained, 58 listed SRT prices. Median prices were
      $49,529 for GK, $31,834 for FSRT, and $22,915 for SRS. Prices varied widely, with
      large ranges corresponding to 2 to 9 times the magnitude of median prices (GK,
      $111,298; FSRT, $312,480; and SRS, $104,396). Adjusting for GPCI, GK (P = .0003) 
      and FSRT (P = .001) were more expensive than SRS, and no difference in price was 
      noted between regions. The FSRT price was positively correlated with GPCI (P =
      .033), but prices for the other techniques were not. Modality prices were all
      positively correlated (all P < .001), meaning that institutions with prices
      greater than the median price for SRS were similarly expensive for GK and FSRT.
      Conclusions: Published prices for SRT vary by delivery system, fractionation, and
      institution without a clear explanation. Obtaining personalized price estimates
      may offer cost savings for patients. Policy changes encouraging reliable access
      to insurer-negotiated cost estimates for SRT are needed.

TI  - Trends in Research on Traditional Chinese Health Exercises for Improving
      Cognitive Function: A Bibliometric Analysis of the Literature From 2001 to 2020.
PG  - 794836
LID - 10.3389/fpubh.2021.794836 [doi]
AB  - Although previous studies have investigated the ability of traditional Chinese
      health exercises (TCHEs) to improve cognitive function, few have utilized
      bibliometric analyses to address this topic. We aimed to investigate the current 
      status of and developmental trends in this field from 2001 to 2020. We searched
      the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) for all research publications on
      cognitive function in relation to TCHEs. CiteSpace V was used to analyze the
      number of papers, countries, institutions, journals, authors, and citations. We
      identified hotspots and trends in the field by drawing co-citation reference and 
      co-occurrence keyword maps. From 2001 to 2020, 406 relevant articles were
      published in the WoSCC, with a gradual increase in the annual number of
      publications. The three countries/regions with the most publications were the
      Chinese mainland, the United States, and Canada. Six universities from China and 
      four from the United States were identified as the top 10 institutions. Most
      research was conducted at universities. Evidence-based Complementary and
      Alternative Medicine was identified as the most productive journal. Together,
      these findings indicate that TCHEs have received increasing attention as a method
      for improving cognition.

TI  - Bibliometric analysis of research on thyroid ultrasonography.
PG  - 3283-3293
LID - 10.21037/gs-21-799 [doi]
AB  - Background: The incidence of thyroid diseases has increased, which may be partly 
      related to the widespread use of thyroid ultrasound resulting in a large number
      of asymptomatic thyroid nodules to be found. Research has found that many thyroid
      ultrasound examinations are completely avoidable. However, the purpose of the
      present study was to use bibliometrics to analyze the relevant research
      literature of thyroid ultrasound and understand the overall status of the current
      research in this field. Methods: We searched the Science Citation Index Expanded 
      (SCI-E) database in the Web of Science Core Collection. Search terms were
      "ultrasonography" and "thyroid gland". The date range for the document search was
      from 1900 to May 10, 2021. Export the full record of the search results and the
      references in txt. format, and use the CiteSpace software to analyze the annual
      publication of literatures, the distribution of countries and institutions where 
      the literatures came from, the distribution of journals and authors. The keywords
      used in the literature were also analyzed. Results: A total of 1,241 publications
      were included in the results, and the frequency of citations was 27,149. The top 
      5 countries for the number of publications published were the USA, Turkey, Italy,
      South Korea, and China; the top 5 countries by centrality were the USA, Germany, 
      Italy, Canada, and China. The number of institution-published papers was
      generally low, and the centrality score was low. Research in this field was
      relatively scattered among institutions and cooperation between institutions was 
      few. There was little collaboration between authors from different institutions. 
      The most cited authors were mainly from European and North American countries.
      Journals, such as Thyroid, Journal of Clinical Ultrasound, and Journal of
      Endocrinological Investigation, had great influence in this field. Keyword
      analysis results showed that research is mainly focused on the differentiation of
      benign and malignant thyroid nodules. Conclusions: There was an increase in
      thyroid ultrasound research, but there was few cooperation exist between
      institutions. The main research direction was the differentiation of benign and
      malignant thyroid nodules.

TI  - Cutaneous Signs in Dermatological Diseases; An Overview.
PG  - 530-539
LID - 10.4103/ijd.ijd_141_21 [doi]
AB  - Cutaneous signs in dermatology are pathognomonic or diagnostic for certain
      conditions. A knowledge of these signs is a useful skill, which must not be
      forgotten in the recent trend towards relying on molecular biology and other
      investigative tools including histological findings to make a diagnosis. The aim 
      of this review is to summarize all cutaneous signs in dermatology in a systematic
      way that would benefit dermatologists, trainee or experienced, in identifying
      diseases and sharpening their clinical skills. A keyword search for the terms
      "cutaneous signs," "sign" AND "dermatology" was conducted through PUBMED, Google,
      and the major textbooks in dermatology (i.e., Rooks Textbook of Dermatology;
      Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine and Dermatology). References were
      searched thoroughly for all cutaneous signs described. One hundred and nineteen
      signs were noted and summarized under the following categories: autoimmune,
      infective, inflammatory, neoplastic, genetic, trauma/miscellaneous. This review
      would serve as a good reference for those wanting to improve their clinical
      acumen in diagnosing dermatological disease.

TI  - The microbiological and physical properties of catheters for intermittent

LID - 10.1038/s41393-021-00740-3 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Systematic Review. OBJECTIVES: To review systematically the
      clinical evidence of the effectiveness of various intermittent catheter cleaning 
      methods that have been proposed as methods to prepare catheters for reuse.
      METHODS: A keyword search in Medline, Excerpta Medica dataBASE, the Cumulative
      Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science and Cochrane
      Central Register of Controlled Trials, was undertaken to identify all English,
      Russian and German language literature evaluating the effectiveness of various
      intermittent catheter cleaning methods. Studies selected for review included
      analytical experimental, prospective cohort and cross-sectional. Cleaning methods
      reviewed included heat-based sterilization, chemical cleaning solutions,
      mechanical abrasion, photocatalytic sterilization, and combined methods. RESULTS:
      Overall, 12 studies were included. Heat-based sterilization and mechanical
      abrasion methods were either not effective or damaged the physical properties of 
      catheters. Two studies reported evidence that their chemical cleaning methods
      (i.e., soaked catheters in a 70% alcohol solution for 5 min or combined approach 
      detergent wash followed by soaking in Milton sterilizing fluid also known as the 
      Milton method) both preserved the structural integrity of their catheters and
      were bactericidal. CONCLUSIONS: Numerous cleaning methods resulted in the
      destruction of catheters. However, there are two reported cleaning methods,
      submersion for 5 min in 70% alcohol and the "Milton method", that eliminate
      bacterial colonization while leaving the physical properties of the catheters
      unchanged. While these cleaning methods are promising, each was published in just
      one study, therefore higher-powered / longitudinal studies confirming the safety 
      and efficacy of these cleaning methods must be obtained before current clinical
      recommendations can be modified.

AB  - Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is a process in which luminescence is produced by 
      oxidizing or reducing luminophores to transfer radiant charges between
      electrochemically generated free radicals. Although about 7000
      electrochemiluminescence articles have been published in the past 20 years
      (2000-2021), only a few review articles have summarized the development and
      application of ECL. In order to better understand the development status,
      research hotspots and future development trends of ECL technology, it is very
      necessary to conduct a comprehensive retrospective analysis. This review is based
      on the bibliometric analysis method of CiteSpace software to quantitatively
      analyze, visually review and comment on the articles published in the field of
      ECL in the past 20 years. Quantitatively analyze the authors, the institutional
      and other basic information to understand the basic development status of ECL,
      and then visually analyze the high-frequency keywords, burst keywords, keyword
      clusters, etc., to understand each the evolution of the main research hotspots
      and development directions of the period, and finally a detailed review and
      analysis of the selected highly cited articles. We particularly emphasized the
      development needs of electrochemiluminescence technology in improving the
      performance of ECL sensors, developing materials with excellent ECL performance, 
      innovating and cooperating with other devices, and developing high-speed and
      high-throughput ECL sensors. We hope to provide new ideas for promoting the
      industrial development and clinical application of electrochemiluminescence
      technology.

TI  - Prediction Models for Severe Manifestations and Mortality due to COVID-19: A
      Systematic Review.
LID - 10.1111/acem.14447 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Throughout 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a
      threat to public health on national and global level. There has been an immediate
      need for research to understand the clinical signs and symptoms of COVID-19 that 
      can help predict deterioration including mechanical ventilation, organ support,
      and death. Studies thus far have addressed the epidemiology of the disease,
      common presentations, and susceptibility to acquisition and transmission of the
      virus; however, an accurate prognostic model for severe manifestations of
      COVID-19 is still needed because of the limited healthcare resources available.
      OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to evaluate published reports of
      prediction models for severe illnesses caused COVID-19. METHODS: Searches were
      developed by the primary author and a medical librarian using an iterative
      process of gathering and evaluating terms. Comprehensive strategies, including
      both index and keyword methods, were devised for PubMed and EMBASE. The data of
      confirmed COVID-19 patients from randomized control studies, cohort studies, and 
      case-control studies published between January 2020 and May 2021were retrieved.
      Studies were independently assessed for risk of bias and applicability using the 
      Prediction Model Risk Of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST). We collected study type,
      setting, sample size, type of validation, and outcome including intubation,
      ventilation, any other type of organ support, or death. The combination of the
      prediction model, scoring system, performance of predictive models, and
      geographic locations were summarized. RESULTS: A primary review found 445
      articles relevant based on title and abstract. After further review, 366 were
      excluded based on the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Seventy-nine
      articles were included in the qualitative analysis. Inter observer agreement on
      inclusion 0.84 (95%CI 0.78 - 0.89).When the PROBAST tool was applied, 70 of the
      79 articles were identified to have high or unclear risk of bias, or high or
      unclear concern for applicability. Nine studies reported prediction models that
      were rated as low risk of bias and low concerns for applicability. CONCLUSION:
      Several prognostic models for COVID-19 were identified, with varying clinical
      score performance. Nine studies that had a low risk of bias and low concern for
      applicability, one from a general public population and hospital setting. The
      most promising and well-validated scores include Clift et al.(15) , and Knight et
      al.(18) , which seem to have accurate prediction models that clinicians can use
      in the public health and emergency department setting.

TI  - Deep Learning Based Homomorphic Secure Search-Able Encryption for Keyword Search 
      in Blockchain Healthcare System: A Novel Approach to Cryptography.
LID - 528 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s22020528 [doi]
AB  - Due to the value and importance of patient health records (PHR), security is the 
      most critical feature of encryption over the Internet. Users that perform keyword
      searches to gain access to the PHR stored in the database are more susceptible to
      security risks. Although a blockchain-based healthcare system can guarantee
      security, present schemes have several flaws. Existing techniques have
      concentrated exclusively on data storage and have utilized blockchain as a
      storage database. In this research, we developed a unique deep-learning-based
      secure search-able blockchain as a distributed database using homomorphic
      encryption to enable users to securely access data via search. Our suggested
      study will increasingly include secure key revocation and update policies. An IoT
      dataset was used in this research to evaluate our suggested access control
      strategies and compare them to benchmark models. The proposed algorithms are
      implemented using smart contracts in the hyperledger tool. The suggested strategy
      is evaluated in comparison to existing ones. Our suggested approach significantly
      improves security, anonymity, and monitoring of user behavior, resulting in a
      more efficient blockchain-based IoT system as compared to benchmark models.

TI  - The most influential articles on kidney transplantation: A PRISMA-compliant
      bibliometric and visualized analysis.
PG  - e28614
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000028614 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Kidney transplantation (KT) has become common in the treatment of
      end-stage renal disease. However, to date, there have been no bibliometric
      analyses of KT research to identify the most influential articles. The purpose of
      this research is to identify and characterize the 100 most cited articles that
      focus on KT and to clarify the trends in the accomplishments in this field.
      METHODS: We searched the Thomson Reuters Web of Science citation indexing
      database and used keyword mapping of VOSviewer. The top 100 most cited
      manuscripts were analyzed based on their titles, authors, institutions, countries
      of origin, years of publication, and topics. RESULTS: The New England Journal of 
      Medicine has published the most manuscripts on kidney transplantation (n = 26)
      and is the most cited journal (n = 15,642). The United States has the highest
      number of publications (n = 61). Kashika is the corresponding author with the
      most published papers (n = 5; 2892 citations). The most common topics of
      publication are immunosuppressant (n = 34), clinical outcome (n = 26), and
      pathology (n = 22). Keywords related to immunosuppressant are the most common in 
      keyword mapping with VOSviewer. CONCLUSIONS: This bibliometric analysis of KT
      research provides the research characteristics and publication trends of this
      topic. In KT research, immunosuppressants and post-transplant clinical outcomes
      have been important topics.

TI  - Symmetry Analysis of Magnetoelectric Effects in Perovskite-Based Multiferroics.
LID - 574 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma15020574 [doi]
AB  - In this article, we performed symmetry analysis of perovskite-based
      multiferroics: bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3)-like, orthochromites (RCrO3), and
      Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites (Ca3Mn2O7-like), being the typical representatives 
      of multiferroics of the trigonal, orthorhombic, and tetragonal crystal families, 
      and we explored the effect of crystallographic distortions on magnetoelectric
      properties. We determined the principal order parameters for each of the
      considered structures and obtained their invariant combinations consistent with
      the particular symmetry. This approach allowed us to analyze the features of the 
      magnetoelectric effect observed during structural phase transitions in
      BixR1-xFeO3 compounds and to show that the rare-earth sublattice has an impact on
      the linear magnetoelectric effect allowed by the symmetry of the new structure.
      It was shown that the magnetoelectric properties of orthochromites are attributed
      to the couplings between the magnetic and electric dipole moments arising near
      Cr(3+) ions due to distortions linked with rotations and deformations of the CrO6
      octahedra. For the first time, such a symmetry consideration was implemented in
      the analysis of the Ruddlesden-Popper structures, which demonstrates the
      possibility of realizing the magnetoelectric effect in the Ruddlesden-Popper
      phases containing magnetically active cations, and allows the estimation of the
      conditions required for its optimization.

TI  - Anti-Electrostatic Pi-Hole Bonding: How Covalency Conquers Coulombics.
LID - 377 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27020377 [doi]
AB  - Intermolecular bonding attraction at pi-bonded centers is often described as
      "electrostatically driven" and given quasi-classical rationalization in terms of 
      a "pi hole" depletion region in the electrostatic potential. However, we
      demonstrate here that such bonding attraction also occurs between closed-shell
      ions of like charge, thereby yielding locally stable complexes that sharply
      violate classical electrostatic expectations. Standard DFT and MP2 computational 
      methods are employed to investigate complexation of simple pi-bonded diatomic
      anions (BO(-), CN(-)) with simple atomic anions (H(-), F(-)) or with one another.
      Such "anti-electrostatic" anion-anion attractions are shown to lead to robust
      metastable binding wells (ranging up to 20-30 kcal/mol at DFT level, or still
      deeper at dynamically correlated MP2 level) that are shielded by broad
      predissociation barriers (ranging up to 1.5 A width) from long-range ionic
      dissociation. Like-charge attraction at pi-centers thereby provides additional
      evidence for the dominance of 3-center/4-electron (3c/4e) nD-pi*AX interactions
      that are fully analogous to the nD-sigma*AH interactions of H-bonding. Using
      standard keyword options of natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis, we demonstrate
      that both n-sigma* (sigma hole) and n-pi* (pi hole) interactions represent simple
      variants of the essential resonance-type donor-acceptor (Burgi-Dunitz-type)
      attraction that apparently underlies all intermolecular association phenomena of 
      chemical interest. We further demonstrate that "deletion" of such pi*-based
      donor-acceptor interaction obliterates the characteristic Burgi-Dunitz signatures
      of pi-hole interactions, thereby establishing the unique cause/effect
      relationship to short-range covalency ("charge transfer") rather than envisioned 
      Coulombic properties of unperturbed monomers.

TI  - Scientometric Analysis of Public Health Emergencies: 1994-2020.
LID - 640 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19020640 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to summarize the research hotspots and frontiers in 
      the field of public health emergencies (PHE) between 1994-2020 through the
      scientometric analysis method. In total, 2247 literature works retrieved from the
      Web of Science core database were analyzed by CiteSpace software, and the results
      were displayed in knowledge mapping. The overall characteristics analysis showed 
      that the number of publications and authors in the field of PHE kept an upward
      trend during the past decades, and the United States was in the leading position,
      followed by China and England. Switzerland has the highest central value and
      plays an important intermediary role in promoting the integration and exchange of
      international PHE research achievements. The keyword co-occurrence analysis
      indicated that COVID-19 was the most high-frequency keyword in this field, and
      there had been no new keywords for a long time until the outbreak of COVID-19 in 
      2019. The burst detection analysis showed that the top five burst keywords in
      terms of burst intensity were zika virus, Ebola, United States, emergency
      preparedness and microcephaly. The results indicated that the research theme of
      PHE is closely related to the major infectious diseases in a specific period. It 
      will continue to develop with more attention paid to public health. The
      conclusions can provide help and reference for the PHE potential researchers.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This bibliometric review of literature on posterior ligamentous
      complex (PLC) injury in thoracolumbar (TL) trauma aims to guide future research. 
      METHODS: We conducted a keyword-based search from January 2000 to September 2021 
      using the Scopus database. Relevant publications were analyzed for the year of
      publication, authorship, publishing journals, institution and country of origin, 
      subject matter, and article type. In addition, content analysis of clinical
      articles was performed, analyzing for sample size, study design (retrospective
      vs. prospective), single vs. multicenter, and level of evidence. RESULTS: 262
      publications have been published in 61 journals by 537 authors, 162 institutions,
      and 29 countries. Thomas Jefferson University, the University of Calgary, and the
      University of Toronto have the largest number of publications related to PLC
      injury. The United States, Canada, and China were the most frequent contributors 
      in terms of the number of publications. Spine was the most prolific and top-cited
      Journal, while Vaccaro A.R. was the most prolific author. The most cited
      publication was the Thoracolumbar Injury Classification and Severity Score
      (TLICS) classification by Vaccaro et al. in 2005. Most of the publications have
      been case studies, with diagnostic accuracy being the most frequently discussed
      topic. The sample size for a large portion of the case series was less than 50.
      The majority of case series were retrospective studies conducted at a single
      center. CONCLUSION: Our review provides an extensive list of the most
      historically significant spinal imaging articles, acknowledging the key
      contributions made to the advancement of this research area.

TI  - The influence of considering individual resistance training variables as a whole 
      on muscle strength: A systematic review and meta-analysis protocol.
PG  - e0262674
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0262674 [doi]
AB  - Examinations of the effect of resistance training (RT) on muscle strength have
      attempted to determine differences between prescriptions, mostly examining
      individual training variables. The broad interaction of variables does not appear
      to be completely considered, nor has a dose-response function been determined.
      This registered (doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/EH94V) systematic review with
      meta-analysis aims to determine if the interaction of individual training
      variables to derive RT dose, dosing, and dosage can influence muscle strength and
      determine if an optimal prescription range exists for developing muscle strength.
      To derive RT dose, the following calculation will be implemented: number of sets 
      x number of repetitions x number of exercises x exercise intensity, while RT
      dosing factors in frequency and RT dosage considers program duration. A keyword
      search strategy utilising interchangeable terms for population (adult),
      intervention (resistance training), and outcomes (strength) will be conducted
      across three databases (CINAHL, MEDLINE, and SPORTDiscus). Novel to the field of 
      exercise prescription, an analytical approach to determine the dose-response
      function for continuous outcomes will be used. The pooled standardised mean
      differences for muscle strength will be estimated using DerSimonian and Laird
      random effects method. Linear and non-linear dose-response relationships will be 
      estimated by fitting fixed effects and random effects models using the one-stage 
      approach to evaluate if there is a relationship between exercise dose, dosing and
      dosage and the effect on muscle strength. Maximised log-likelihood and the Akaike
      Information Criteria will be used to compare alternative best fitting models.
      Meta regressions will investigate between-study variances and a funnel plot and
      Egger's test will assess publication bias. The results from this study will
      identify if an optimal prescription range for dose, dosing and dosage exists to
      develop muscle strength.

TI  - The comparative landscape of Chinese and foreign articles on the carbon footprint
      using bibliometric analysis.
LID - 10.1007/s11356-022-18493-8 [doi]
AB  - In recent years, the carbon footprint is regarded as the most important
      assessment tool of greenhouse gas emissions; it has attracted great attention of 
      Chinese and foreign governments, enterprises, and relevant scholars. However, the
      comparative bibliometric analysis of Chinese and foreign articles on the carbon
      footprint research is still limited; thus, it has become the motivation of the
      present study. To quantitatively analyse the bibliometric differences between
      Chinese and foreign literature of the carbon footprint research, 673 Chinese
      articles and 3755 foreign articles between 2007 and 2020 were extracted from the 
      Web of Science Core Collection database. On this basis, the publications,
      publishers, journals, authors, and institutions of Chinese and foreign articles
      were compared, and especially, the keyword and citation analysis results were
      obtained via the biblioshiny tool of bibliometrix R package. Results show that
      the output and influence of foreign articles are more prominent than Chinese
      articles in general. The foreign carbon footprint research is more systematic and
      mature than Chinese research, and both sides have some research topics of common 
      concern and maintain their own research characteristics. Specific results may
      provide some reference for relevant researchers, policy makers, and the public.

TI  - Mapping of global research output in congenital cataracts from 1903 to 2021.
PG  - e27756
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000027756 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Globally, congenital cataract remains one of the main causes 
      of visual loss in children. This study was designed to plot the overall research 
      output and evaluate some key bibliometric indicators in congenital cataracts
      research. METHODS: Publications on congenital cataracts were retrieved from the
      Web of Science Core Collection database. The published literature was searched
      using the keywords "congenital cataract" OR "congenital cataracts" in the title
      filed with document types and language restrictions. The data were exported into 
      HistCite to analyze; publication year, top authors, countries, institutions,
      journals, keywords, and most cited studies. VOSviewer software was used to
      construct network visualization mapping. RESULTS: A total of 1427 publications
      (1903-2021) published in English language were included in this study. Over the
      past few decades, the total number of publications in congenital cataracts was
      found to be increased. The most productive year was 2016 (n = 72), while the most
      cited year was 1941 (1268 citations). The Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual
      Science (Impact Factor: 4.799) was the most attractive journal with 161
      publications, and the Molecular Vision (Impact Factor : 2.367) was the most cited
      journal with 1915 citations and 161.723 citations per year. The most productive
      country was the United States of America (USA) (n = 325), while the most active
      institute was Sun Yat-sen University, China (n = 36). The most prolific author
      was Yao K (n = 27). The most studied Web of Science category was ophthalmology (n
      = 852). The most widely used keyword was congenital (n = 1427). The most cited
      paper in congenital cataracts was "Congenital cataract following German measles
      in the mother, cited 1268 times. The USA and author keyword congenital cataract
      had the highest total link strength. CONCLUSION: These findings provide useful
      insights, current status, and trends in clinical research in congenital
      cataracts. This study can be used to identify future research areas and standard 
      bibliography references for better diagnosis and disease control.

PG  - 775495
LID - 10.3389/fmed.2021.775495 [doi]
AB  - Background and Aims: To evaluate endoscopic sedation research and predict
      research hot spots both quantitatively and qualitatively using bibliometric
      analysis. Methods: We extracted relevant publications from the Web of Science
      Core Collection (WoSCC) on 13 December 2020. We examined the retrieved data by
      bibliometric analysis (e.g., co-cited and cluster analysis, keyword
      co-occurrence) using the software CiteSpace and VOSviewer and the website of
      bibliometrics, the Online Analysis Platform of Literature Metrology
      (http://bibliometric.com/), to analyse and predict the trends and hot spots in
      this field. Main Results: We identified 2,879 articles and reviews on endoscopic 
      sedation published between 2001 and 2020. Although the overall trend is
      increasing, with slight fluctuation in some years, there were significant
      increases in 2007 and 2012. In respect of the contributions on endoscopic
      sedation research, the United States (US) had the greatest number of
      publications, and it was followed by Japan and China. In addition, collaboration 
      network analysis revealed that the most frequent collaboration was between the US
      and China. Six of the top ten most prolific research institutions were located in
      the US. The most publications on endoscopic sedation research in the past two
      decades were found primarily in journals on gastroenterology and hepatology.
      Keyword co-occurrence and co-citation cluster analysis revealed the most popular 
      terms relating to endoscopic sedation in the manner of cluster labels; these
      included patient anxiety, tolerance, ketamine, propofol, hypoxia, nursing
      shortage, endoscopic ultrasonography, colorectal cancer, carbon dioxide
      insufflation, and water exchange (WE). Keyword burst detection suggested that
      propofol sedation, adverse event, adenoma detection rate (ADR), hypoxemia, and
      obesity were newly-emergent research hot spots. Conclusions: Our findings showed 
      that hypoxia, adverse event, and ADR, along with conscious sedation and propofol 
      sedation, have been foci of endoscopic sedation research over the past 20 years. 
      The research focus has shifted from sedative drugs to sedative complications and 
      endoscopy quality control, which means that there will be higher requirements and
      standards for sedative quality and endoscopy quality in the future.

TI  - Mapping Intellectual Structures and Research Hotspots of Triple Negative Breast
      Cancer: A Bibliometric Analysis.
PG  - 689553
LID - 10.3389/fonc.2021.689553 [doi]
AB  - Background: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly heterogeneous breast
      cancer subtype with a poor prognosis due to its extremely aggressive nature and
      lack of effective treatment options. This study aims to summarize the current
      hotspots of TNBC research and evaluate the TNBC research trends, both
      qualitatively and quantitatively. Methods: Scientific publications of
      TNBC-related studies from January 1, 2010 to October 17, 2020 were obtained from 
      the Web of Science database. The BICOMB software was used to obtain the
      high-frequency keywords layout. The gCLUTO was used to produce a biclustering
      analysis on the binary matrix of word-paper. The co-occurrence and collaboration 
      analysis between authors, countries, institutions, and keywords were performed by
      VOSviewer software. Keyword burst detection was performed by CiteSpace. Results: 
      A total of 12,429 articles related to TNBC were identified. During 2010-2020, the
      most productive country/region and institution in TNBC field was the USA and The 
      University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, respectively. Cancer Research,
      Journal of Clinical Oncology, and Annals of Oncology were the first three
      periodicals with maximum publications in TNBC research. Eight research hotspots
      of TNBC were identified by co-word analysis. In the core hotspots, research on
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy, paclitaxel therapy, and molecular typing of TNBC is
      relatively mature. Research on immunotherapy and PARP inhibitor for TNBC is not
      yet mature but is the current focus of this field. Burst detection of keywords
      showed that studies on TNBC proteins and receptors, immunotherapy, target, and
      tumor cell migration showed bursts in recent three years. Conclusion: The current
      study revealed that TNBC studies are growing. Attention should be paid to the
      latest hotspots, such as immunotherapy, PARP inhibitors, target, and TNBC
      proteins and receptors.

      for Cartilage Regeneration: A Bibliometric Analysis From 2010 to 2020.
PG  - 737939
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2021.737939 [doi]
AB  - Background: Defects of articular cartilage represent a common condition that
      usually progresses to osteoarthritis with pain and dysfunction of the joint.
      Current treatment strategies have yielded limited success in these patients. Stem
      cells are emerging as a promising option for cartilage regeneration. We aim to
      summarize the developmental history of stem cells for cartilage regeneration and 
      to analyse the relevant trends and hotspots. Methods: We screened all relevant
      literature on stem cells for cartilage regeneration from Web of Science during
      2010-2020 and analysed the research trends in this field by VOSviewer and
      CiteSpace. We also summarized previous clinical trials. Results: We screened
      1,011 publications. China contributed the largest number of publications (317,
      31.36%) and citations (81,376, 48.61%). The United States achieved the highest
      H-index (39). Shanghai Jiao Tong University had the largest number of
      publications (34) among all full-time institutions. The Journal of Biomaterials
      and Stem Cell Research and Therapy published the largest number of studies on
      stem cells for cartilage regeneration (35). SEKIYA I and YANG F published the
      majority of articles in this field (14), while TOH WS was cited most frequently
      (740). Regarding clinical research on stem cells for cartilage regeneration, the 
      keyword "double-blind" emerged in recent years, with an average year of 2018.75. 
      In tissue engineering, the keyword "3D printing" appeared latest, with an average
      year of 2019.625. In biological studies, the key word "extracellular vesicles"
      appeared latest, with an average year of 2018.9091. The current research trend
      indicates that basic research is gradually transforming to tissue engineering.
      Clinical trials have confirmed the safety and feasibility of stem cells for
      cartilage regeneration. Conclusion: Multiple scientific methods were employed to 
      reveal productivity, collaborations, and research hotspots related to the use of 
      stem cells for cartilage regeneration. 3D printing, extracellular vesicles, and
      double-blind clinical trials are research hotspots and are likely to be promising
      in the near future. Further studies are needed for to improve our understanding
      of this field, and clinical trials with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up 
      periods are needed for clinical transformation.

AB  - This paper aims to examine the worldwide research development and trends in
      forensic anthropology by using bibliometric analysis. Scopus database was used to
      identify published papers on forensic anthropology from 1948 to 2020. A total of 
      4,499 records were analyzed for yearly publication productivity, authorship and
      citation pattern, types of documents, most productive journals, organizations,
      authors, and countries, frequently cited papers, most used keywords, countries of
      collaboration, and three-field plot analysis in the domain of forensic
      anthropology. The results indicated that the highest grand total publications
      were between the years 2016 and 2019, while the highest multi-authored
      publications were in the year 2018. The most productive journal, author,
      organization, and country were the 'Journal of Forensic Sciences' with grand
      total publications of 934, 'Cattaneo, C.' with 97 publications, 'Centre National 
      de la Recherche Scientifique' with 130 publications, and the United States with
      1020 total cited papers, respectively. The document with the highest number of
      citations was 'Buckberry and Chamberlain, 2002, Am J Phys Anthropol' with a total
      of 387. Three-field plot analysis regarding the most outstanding
      keyword-source-country was "Forensic anthropology"- "Journal of Forensic
      Sciences" and "Forensic Science International"- "USA", "France", and "UK". The
      predomination of certain countries over others in the field of forensic
      anthropology limits its prosperity as ethnic variety is of important regard.
      Research collaborations were mainly observed between the United States and
      European countries, which highlights the need for strengthening collaborations
      between developed and developing nations.

TI  - On the use of virtual reality for individuals with upper limb loss: a systematic 
      scoping review.
LID - 10.23736/S1973-9087.22.06794-6 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Virtual Reality has recently become a popular application for
      rehabilitation and motor control research. This technology has emerged as a valid
      addition to conventional therapy and promises a successful rehabilitation. This
      study describes recent research related to the use of virtual reality
      applications in the rehabilitation of individuals with upper limb loss and to see
      whether this technology has enough proof of its applicability. EVIDENCE
      ACQUISITION: Searches were conducted with the Web of Science, Google Scholar,
      IEEE Xplore, and PubMed databases from inception up to September 2020. Articles
      that employed virtual reality in the rehabilitation of individual with upper limb
      loss were included in the research if it is written in English, the keyword
      exists in the title and abstract; it uses visual feedback in non-immersive,
      semiimmersive, or fully immersive virtual environments. Data extraction was
      carried out by two independent researchers. The study was drafted using the
      Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis Protocols
      (PRISMA). EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: A total of 38 articles met the inclusion criteria. 
      Most studies were published between 2010 and 2020. 39% of the studies (n=15),
      originates from North America; 55% of the studies (n=21), were publicly funded;
      61% of the studies (n=24), was without disclosure of conflict of interest; 82% of
      the studies (n=31), were cited in other studies. All the studies were published
      in journals and conference proceedings. 66% of the studies (n=25), has come out
      with positive outcome. The design studies were mostly case reports, case series, 
      and poorly designed cohort studies that made up 55% (n=21) of all the studies
      cited here. CONCLUSIONS: The research conducted on the use of virtual reality in 
      individual with upper limb loss rehabilitation is of very low quality. The
      improvements to the research protocol are much needed. It is not necessary to
      develop new devices, but rather to assess existing devices with well-conducted
      randomized controlled trials.

TI  - A review of the advances in composites/nanocomposites for triboelectric
      nanogenerators.
LID - 10.1088/1361-6528/ac4b7b [doi]
AB  - Material development is essential when studying triboelectric nanogenerators
      (TENGs). This importance is because the performance of TENGs are highly dependent
      on the properties of the utilized triboelectric materials. To obtain more
      specific properties, composites have been developed that combine the features of 
      their components. According to Google Scholar, 55% of published papers related to
      triboelectric nanogenerators have utilized or mentioned composites. This number
      is 34.5% if one searches with the keyword nanocomposites instead of composites.
      The importance of composites is because they can exhibit new dielectric
      properties, better mechanical strength, enhanced charge affinities, etc.
      Therefore, the development of new composites has great importance in TENG
      studies. In this paper, we review the production of nanocomposites, the types of 
      nanocomposites, and their application in TENG studies. This review gives an
      overview of how nanocomposites boost the performance of TENGs and provides
      guidance for future studies.

TI  - Occult craniocervical dissociation on cervical CT: an under-appreciated
      presentation of craniocervical trauma requiring occipital cervical fusion.
LID - 10.1007/s10140-022-02018-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Craniocervical dissociation is a rare and
      life-threatening injury that results from a significant
      hyperflexion-hyperextension force. Occult craniocervical dissociation is defined 
      as an unstable craniocervical injury in the absence of atlanto-occipital joint
      space widening or other skull base line abnormality. The early and accurate
      diagnosis of craniocervical dissociation is crucial since the early diagnosis and
      subsequent stabilization with occipital-cervical fusion has been shown to reduce 
      neurologic morbidity and mortality. Several normative skull base lines have been 
      developed to predict craniocervical dissociation. The purpose of our study was to
      measure the atlanto-occipital joint space and four other common skull base lines 
      in patients who underwent occipital-cervical fusion for post-traumatic
      craniocervical instability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who underwent
      occipital-cervical fusion for craniocervical injury were identified
      retrospectively using a keyword search of radiology reports using Nuance mPower
      software. The cervical CT and MRI exams for these patients were reviewed and the 
      atlanto-occipital joint space, Powers ratio, Wackenheim line, posterior axial
      line, and basion dens interval were measured. Detailed descriptions of
      craniocervical ligament injuries on MRI were recorded along with patient
      demographic information, clinical history, management, and outcome. RESULTS: Nine
      adult patients who underwent occipital-cervical fusion for an acute
      craniocervical injury were identified. Six patients demonstrated an
      atlanto-occipital joint space measuring 2 mm or less on cervical spine CT with no
      additional abnormality in the Powers ratio, Wackenheim line, posterior axial
      line, or basion-dens interval. Three patients demonstrated widening of the
      atlanto-occipital joint space with two patients demonstrating an abnormality in
      at least two additional skull base lines. Clinical outcomes were variable with
      nearly half of the patients demonstrating persistent neurologic deficits,
      including one quadriplegic patient. CONCLUSIONS: A normal atlanto-occipital joint
      space and skull base line measurements on cervical CT demonstrated a low
      predictive value for detecting unstable craniocervical injuries. Occult
      craniocervical dissociation was present in two-thirds of patients who underwent
      occipital cervical fusion for acute, craniocervical trauma. A high clinical and
      radiologic index of suspicion for craniocervical trauma with subsequent follow-up
      cervical MRI to directly evaluate ligamentous integrity is necessary to
      accurately diagnose and triage patients with high velocity trauma.

      Classification.
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2022.3141976 [doi]
AB  - Recent applications of deep learning have shown promising results for classifying
      unstructured text in the healthcare domain. However, the reliability of models in
      production settings has been hindered by imbalanced data sets in which a small
      subset of the classes dominate. In the absence of adequate training data, rare
      classes necessitate additional model constraints for robust performance. Here, we
      present a strategy for incorporating short sequences of text (i.e.~ keywords)
      into training to boost model accuracy on rare classes. In our approach, we
      assemble a set of keywords, including short phrases, associated with each class. 
      The keywords are then used as additional data during each batch of model
      training, resulting in a training loss that has contributions from both raw data 
      and keywords. We evaluate our approach on classification of cancer pathology
      reports, which shows a substantial increase in model performance for rare
      classes. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of keywords on model output
      probabilities for bigrams, providing a straightforward method to identify model
      difficulties for limited training data.

TI  - Assessment of Natural Language Processing Methods for Ascertaining the Expanded
      Disability Status Scale Score From the Electronic Health Records of Patients With
      Multiple Sclerosis: Algorithm Development and Validation Study.
PG  - e25157
LID - 10.2196/25157 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score is a widely used
      measure to monitor disability progression in people with multiple sclerosis (MS).
      However, extracting and deriving the EDSS score from unstructured electronic
      health records can be time-consuming. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare rule-based
      and deep learning natural language processing algorithms for detecting and
      predicting the total EDSS score and EDSS functional system subscores from the
      electronic health records of patients with MS. METHODS: We studied 17,452
      electronic health records of 4906 MS patients followed at one of Canada's largest
      MS clinics between June 2015 and July 2019. We randomly divided the records into 
      training (80%) and test (20%) data sets, and compared the performance
      characteristics of 3 natural language processing models. First, we applied a
      rule-based approach, extracting the EDSS score from sentences containing the
      keyword "EDSS." Next, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to
      predict the 19 half-step increments of the EDSS score. Finally, we used a
      combined rule-based-CNN model. For each approach, we determined the accuracy,
      precision, recall, and F-score compared with the reference standard, which was
      manually labeled EDSS scores in the clinic database. RESULTS: Overall, the
      combined keyword-CNN model demonstrated the best performance, with accuracy,
      precision, recall, and an F-score of 0.90, 0.83, 0.83, and 0.83 respectively.
      Respective figures for the rule-based and CNN models individually were 0.57,
      0.91, 0.65, and 0.70, and 0.86, 0.70, 0.70, and 0.70. Because of missing data,
      the model performance for EDSS subscores was lower than that for the total EDSS
      score. Performance improved when considering notes with known values of the EDSS 
      subscores. CONCLUSIONS: A combined keyword-CNN natural language processing model 
      can extract and accurately predict EDSS scores from patient records. This
      approach can be automated for efficient information extraction in clinical and
      research settings.

TI  - New learning area in laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer: YouTube(R) or
      WebSurg(R)?
PG  - 129-135
LID - 10.4103/jmas.JMAS_300_20 [doi]
AB  - Background: Laparoscopic gastrectomy cannot be performed routinely in many
      centres, because there is still no standardisation in the centres where it is
      performed, and therefore, new learning areas are needed for residents working in 
      these centres for surgical training. These areas are various courses, video
      training sets and video platforms watched over the internet. The most frequently 
      used platforms are YouTube((R)) and WebSurg((R)). Our aim is to compare these two
      online video platforms in terms of laparoscopic gastrectomy and to evaluate the
      contribution of video platforms to surgical training and whether they have
      sufficient technical quality. Materials and Methods: We made a search on
      YouTube((R)) and WebSurg((R)) using the keyword 'laparoscopic gastrectomy' on 13 
      November 2020. A total of 143 videos were analysed, 111 of them on YouTube((R))
      and 32 on WebSurg((R)). All these videos were examined by two surgical
      oncologists experienced in laparoscopic gastrectomy and using laparoscopy in
      their daily practice. Results: The average video duration was 53.54 min in the
      YouTube((R)) group and 18.20 min in the WebSurg((R)) group, and this difference
      was found to be statistically significant between the two groups. According to
      the LGSS based on surgical procedures, the average score of WebSurg((R)) videos
      was 10.37 and of YouTube((R)) videos was 5.55, and there was a statistically
      significant difference between the two groups. Conclusions: Today, video
      platforms have started to play a major role in surgical training. Of these
      platforms examined, WebSurg((R)) is superior to YouTube((R)) in terms of
      education and quality, but these platforms still have some deficiencies and need 
      regulation.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak is
      currently ravaging populations worldwide. Many studies were registered and
      conducted in rapid response to the epidemic, but how to choose the proper design 
      for clinical trials remains the main concern. This study aimed to determine the
      fundamental characteristics of study design during the COVID-19 pandemic and
      provide references for other emerging infectious diseases. METHODS: We searched
      the database of ClinicalTrials.gov with the keyword "COVID-19" and compared the
      results with the design features of other conventional studies except for
      COVID-19. RESULTS: From January 1, 2020 to September 30, 2021, 55,334 trials were
      registered at ClinicalTrials.gov. Of all the registered trials, 6,408 were
      related to COVID-19 (11.58%). There were significant differences in the
      proportion of observational studies between COVID-19 (43.48%) and others
      (23.27%). The completion rate of observational trials and interventional trials
      in COVID-19 was 29.04% and 25.84%, respectively. COVID-19 trials showed a higher 
      rate of completion than others (P<0.01). The time distribution and trend of
      observational studies and interventional studies varied considerably. CONCLUSION:
      Appropriately designed trials can help to improve research efficiency and reduce 
      the possibility of research failure. In addition to randomized controlled trials,
      observational and single-armed studies are also worth considering.

PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.1080/21645515.2021.2014733 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite recent advances in human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1)
      prevention, a fast, safe, and effective vaccine will probably be necessary to end
      the HIV/AIDS pandemic. This study was conducted to evaluate global research
      trends and map the key bibliometric indices in HIV-1 genetic diversity from 1998 
      to 2021. METHODS: A comprehensive online search was conducted in the Web of
      Science Core Collection database to retrieve published literature on HIV-1
      genetic diversity. Key bibliometric indicators were calculated and evaluated
      using HistCite(TM), Bibliometrix: An R-tool, and VOSviewer software for windows. 
      RESULTS: A total of 2,060 documents written by 9,201 authors and published in 250
      journals were included in the final analysis. Year 2012 was the most productive
      year with 121 (5.87%) publications. The most prolific author was Shao Yiming (n =
      74, 3.59%) from Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The United
      States of America was the highly contributing and influential country (n = 681,
      33.05%). AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses was the most productive journal (n 
      = 562, 27.2%). Network visualization shows that HIV-1 was the most widely used
      author keyword. CONCLUSION: This study provides global research trends and
      detailed information on HIV-1 genetic diversity. The amount of scientific
      literature on HIV-1 genetic diversity research has rapidly increased in the last 
      two decades. The maximum number of articles on HIV-1 genetic diversity was
      published in developed countries; therefore, a scientific research collaboration 
      among researchers and institutes in low-income countries should be promoted and
      supported.

      implant restoration treatment.
PG  - 12664-12677
LID - 10.21037/apm-21-3449 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: With the continuous improvement of human living standards, more and
      more dental patients are requiring oral implant restoration treatment. However,
      there is still controversy regarding the influence of risk factors such as
      osteoporosis, radiotherapy, diabetes, and smoking on the failure of oral
      implants. This study aimed to explore the correlation between risk factors and
      failure of oral implant restoration treatment. METHODS: The databases of China
      National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Baidu Academic, Weipu, Wanfang, PubMed,
      EBSCO, Medline, Web of knowledge, Ovid, and the Cochrane Library were searched.
      The search strategies included: subject terms related to research results such as
      survival, osseointegration, failure, removal, replacement, and loss; related to
      risk factors: osteoporosis, head and neck cancer, diabetes, and smoking; and oral
      implantology as a keyword. RESULTS: Thirty-two articles were included in
      meta-analysis, there was a high heterogeneity between radiotherapy and dental
      implant failure (I2=71.6%, P=0.000), and there was an obvious correlation between
      radiotherapy and dental implant failure [relative risk (RR) =2.09, 95%
      confidential interval (CI): 1.68-2.61]. There was heterogeneity between diabetes 
      and oral implant failure in the included articles (I2=59.6%, P=0.084). There was 
      no remarkable correlation between osteoporosis and dental implant failure (RR
      =1.19, 95% CI: 0.81-1.74). There was a high heterogeneity between smoking and
      dental implant failure in the included articles (I2=33.8%, P=0.092), showing
      obvious correlation (RR =1.80, 95% CI: 1.53-2.11). DISCUSSION: The results of
      meta-analysis confirmed that radiotherapy and smoking were greatly associated
      with oral implant failure.

TI  - Arthroscopic treatment of osteoarthritis: a bibliometric study.
PG  - 12575-12588
LID - 10.21037/apm-21-3548 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis is a common disease among middle-aged and older
      adults. The arthroscopic approach is among the less traumatic of the treatments
      and provides quicker recovery. The purpose of this study was to use bibliometrics
      analysis to clarify the current status and existing problems in the research of
      the arthroscopic treatment of osteoarthritis. METHODS: The Science Citation Index
      Expanded (SCI-E) database in the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC) was used 
      as the data source for the literature search. The search terms were
      "osteoarthritis" and "arthroscopy", with the intersection of the search results
      of these 2 search terms being used. CiteSpace software used to analyze the final 
      results of the search in the following aspects: annual publication, subject
      distribution, country/institution distribution, journal distribution, author
      distribution, and keyword usage. Finally, burst detection was applied to analyze 
      the annual use trend of the keywords. RESULTS: A total of 2,738 document records 
      were retrieved, and the frequency of citations was 82,932 times. The number of
      publications and the number of citations showed an obvious annual increasing
      trend. The country with the highest number of publications and centrality was the
      United States of America, and most important research institutions were from the 
      United States. Extensive cooperation between countries and institutions was
      evident. The important journals in this field were mainly professional journals
      of orthopedics and joints. Keyword analysis showed that early research mainly
      focused on the technical operation of arthroscopic treatment of osteoarthritis,
      while the focus in recent years has been on long-term prognosis and risk
      prediction. CONCLUSIONS: The application of arthroscopy in the treatment for
      osteoarthritis should be further explored, especially for large joints other than
      hip and knee joints.

TI  - Identification and Quantification, Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics,
      Pharmacological Activities, and Botanical Preparations of Protopine: A Review.
LID - 215 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27010215 [doi]
AB  - Through pharmacological activity research, an increasing number of natural
      products and their derivatives are being recognized for their therapeutic value. 
      In recent years, studies have been conducted on Corydalis yanhusuo W.T. Wang, a
      valuable medicinal herb listed in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. Protopine, one of
      its components, has also become a research hotspot. To illustrate the
      identification, metabolism, and broad pharmacological activity of protopine and
      the botanical preparations containing it for further scientific studies and
      clinical applications, an in-depth and detailed review of protopine is required. 
      We collected data on the identification and quantification, metabolism and
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacological activities, and botanical preparations of
      protopine from 1986 to 2021 from the PubMed database using "protopine" as a
      keyword. It has been shown that protopine as an active ingredient of many
      botanical preparations can be rapidly screened and quantified by a large number
      of methods (such as the LC-ESI-MS/MS and the TLC/GC-MS), and the possible
      metabolic pathways of protopine in vivo have been proposed. In addition,
      protopine possesses a wide range of pharmacological activities such as
      anti-inflammatory, anti-platelet aggregation, anti-cancer, analgesic,
      vasodilatory, anticholinesterase, anti-addictive, anticonvulsant, antipathogenic,
      antioxidant, hepatoprotective, neuroprotective, and cytotoxic and
      anti-proliferative activities. In this paper, the identification and
      quantification, metabolism and pharmacokinetics, pharmacological activities, and 
      botanical preparations of protopine are reviewed in detail to lay a foundation
      for further scientific research and clinical applications of protopine.

TI  - Long-Term Space Nutrition: A Scoping Review.
LID - 194 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14010194 [doi]
AB  - This scoping review aimed to identify current evidence and gaps in the field of
      long-term space nutrition. Specifically, the review targeted critical nutritional
      needs during long-term manned missions in outer space in addition to the
      essential components of a sustainable space nutrition system for meeting these
      needs. The search phrase "space food and the survival of astronauts in long-term 
      missions" was used to collect the initial 5432 articles from seven Chinese and
      seven English databases. From these articles, two independent reviewers screened 
      titles and abstracts to identify 218 articles for full-text reviews based on
      three themes and 18 keyword combinations as eligibility criteria. The results
      suggest that it is possible to address short-term adverse environmental factors
      and nutritional deficiencies by adopting effective dietary measures, selecting
      the right types of foods and supplements, and engaging in specific sustainable
      food production and eating practices. However, to support self-sufficiency during
      long-term space exploration, the most optimal and sustainable space nutrition
      systems are likely to be supported primarily by fresh food production, natural
      unprocessed foods as diets, nutrient recycling of food scraps and cultivation
      systems, and the establishment of closed-loop biospheres or landscape-based space
      habitats as long-term life support systems.

TI  - An Investigation into Art Therapy Aided Health and Well-Being Research: A 75-Year
      Bibliometric Analysis.
LID - 232 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19010232 [doi]
AB  - Considering the physical, and psychological impacts and challenges brought about 
      the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), art therapy (AT) provides opportunities 
      to promote human health and well-being. There are few systematic analysis studies
      in the fields of AT, which can provide content and direction for the potential
      value and impact of AT. Therefore, this paper aims to critically analyze the
      published work in the field of AT from the perspective of promoting health and
      well-being, and provides insights into current research status, hotspots,
      limitations, and future development trends of AT. This paper adopts a mixed
      method of quantitative and qualitative analysis including bibliometric analysis
      and keyword co-occurrence analysis. The results indicate that: (1) the current
      studies on AT are mostly related to research and therapeutic methods, types of
      AT, research populations and diseases, and evaluation of therapeutic effect of
      AT. The research method of AT mainly adopts qualitative research, among which
      creative arts therapy and group AT are common types of AT, and its main research 
      populations are children, veterans, and adolescents. AT-aided diseases are
      trauma, depression, psychosis, dementia, and cancer. In addition, the therapeutic
      methods are mainly related to psychotherapy, drama, music, and dance/movement.
      Further, computer systems are an important evaluation tool in the research of AT;
      (2) the future development trend of AT-aided health and well-being based on
      research hotspots, could be focused on children, schizophrenia, well-being,
      mental health, palliative care, veterans, and the elderly within the context of
      addressing COVID-19 challenges; and (3) future AT-aided health and well-being
      could pay more attention to innovate and integrate the therapeutic methods of
      behavior, movement, and technology, such as virtual reality and remote
      supervision.

TI  - Easily accessible but easily forgettable: How ease of access to information
      online affects cognitive miserliness.
LID - 10.1037/xap0000412 [doi]
AB  - Ubiquitous Internet access has provided easy access to information and has
      influenced users' attention and knowledge management. In an online information
      service context, this research examines how the perception of easy access to
      information affects strategies to learn two types of information: "what it is"
      and "how to access it." This study also examines how the learning process is
      moderated by individual differences in working memory capacity, which can
      determine efficient management of attentional resources. The results show that
      individuals, especially those who rank high in working memory capacity, are less 
      likely to remember the details but are more likely to remember how to access the 
      information (e.g., a keyword for a search engine query). Those with higher
      working memory capacity are also more likely to ensure easy access to information
      by subscribing to information sources. The findings suggest that cognitive
      miserliness is not due to users' lack of cognitive capacity but to the
      accessibility of online information and efficient execution of attentional
      resources. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved).

TI  - Analysis of the supportive care needs of the parents of preterm children in South
      Korea using big data text-mining: Topic modeling.
PG  - 34-42
LID - 10.4094/chnr.2021.27.1.34 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to identify the supportive care needs of
      parents of preterm children in South Korea using text data from a portal site.
      Methods: In total, 628 online newspaper articles and 1,966 social network service
      posts published between January 1 and December 31, 2019 were analyzed. The
      procedures in this study were conducted in the following order: keyword
      selection, data collection, morpheme analysis, keyword analysis, and topic
      modeling. Results: The term "yirundung-yi", which is a native Korean word
      referring to premature infants, was confirmed to be a useful term for parents.
      The following four topics were identified as the supportive care needs of parents
      of preterm children: 1) a vague fear of caring for a baby upon imminent neonatal 
      intensive care unit discharge, 2) real-world difficulties encountered while
      caring for preterm children, 3) concerns about growth and development problems,
      and 4) anxiety about possible complications. Conclusion: Supportive care
      interventions for parents of preterm children should include general parenting
      methods for babies. A team composed of multidisciplinary experts must support the
      individual growth and development of preterm children and manage the
      complications of prematurity using highly accessible media.

TI  - Delayed Eruption of Permanent Lower Lateral Incisor in Relation to Compound
      Odontoma: A Case Report.
PG  - 1060-1062
AB  - AIM: To report a delayed tooth eruption following late surgical removal of a
      compound odontoma in a 10-year-old child. BACKGROUND: Odontomas are the most
      common odontogenic tumors. They are usually asymptomatic and discovered during
      routine radiographic examinations or during an assessment of delayed tooth
      eruption. Odontomas are classified into compound or complex based on the
      microscopic structure of dental tissues. Early diagnosis and surgical removal of 
      odontomas is the keyword for favorable results. CASE DESCRIPTION: This paper
      describes a case of compound odontomas in a 10-year-old boy that prevented
      eruption of the permanent mandibular lateral incisor. Extraction of mandibular
      primary lateral incisors and surgical excision of the compound odontomas was
      performed. After 3 years of follow-up, at the age of 13 years, the permanent
      lateral incisor erupted and approached the occlusal plane. CONCLUSION: Late
      surgical removal of odontomas resulted in a delayed eruption of the affected
      teeth. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Surgical removal of odontomas and regular follow-up
      to monitor the eruption of the affected teeth should be considered for the teeth 
      with an open apex before considering orthodontic traction.

TI  - Effect of horticultural therapy on mental health: A meta-analysis of randomized
      controlled trials.
LID - 10.1111/jpm.12818 [doi]
AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: Mental health assessment is a common topic in
      horticultural therapy (HT). Some study findings were contrary to positive
      findings, although several studies have explored the effect of HT on mental
      health and reported positive results. There is weak evidence in the benefits of
      HT based on evidence-based medicine. Stronger evidence of the link between HT and
      mental health will help in policy making by health policy makers and governments.
      WHAT THE PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: The purpose of this meta-analysis of 
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was to explore the effect of HT on mental
      health. This study is the first meta-analysis of RCTs to provide critical
      evidence that HT has a positive effect on mental health. The effect size of HT on
      mental health was medium (0.55). The included studies had no negative effects on 
      mental health. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: HT should be considered a
      useful therapy to be integrated in healthcare settings by horticultural
      therapists to improve mental health. In the HT program, indoor and outdoor plant 
      activities, plant-related arts, crafts and other activities were common
      interventions to improve specific mental health problems through at least eight
      sessions. ABSTRACT: Introduction HT has been widely used to promote mental
      health. However, heterogeneity and sample size issues of randomized controlled
      trials made it challenging to illustrate effect sizes across the evidence. Aim
      The purpose of this meta-analysis was to explore the effect of HT on mental
      health. Methods We used the PRISMA framework. A keyword search of Web of Science,
      PubMed, ProQuest and Cochrane was performed. The inclusion criteria were HT with 
      RCTs and mental health assessments. A random-effects model was used to perform
      the meta-analysis. Results A total of 1,056 records were searched, and 18
      eligible studies were extracted. The included RCTs had no statistical
      heterogeneity and publication bias. The meta-analysis showed that the HT
      experimental groups had a significant and positive impact on mental health
      compared with the control groups (effect size = 0.55). Discussion HT should be
      considered for enhancing mental health. The included studies had no negative
      outcomes and the most common HT intervention was at least eight sessions.
      Therefore, HT should be considered to enhance mental health. However, the
      concealed allocation and blinding processes should be improved in future studies.
      Implications for Practice: This study recommends that HT should be integrated
      into healthcare settings to improve mental health.

TI  - [Hotspots and trends of Ophiopogonis Radix based on CiteSpace knowledge map].
PG  - 6549-6557

AB  - Ophiopogonis Radix is an important Yin-nourishing drug in traditional Chinese
      medicine(TCM), with the effects of nourishing Yin, promoting fluid production,
      clearing away heart-fire, and relieving restlessness. It is widely used in
      clinical practice due to its multiple chemical components and pharmacological
      effects. The technique &quot;mapping knowledge domains&quot; is an effective tool
      to quantitatively and objectively visualize the development frontiers and trends 
      of certain disciplines. In this study, TCM research papers related to
      Ophiopogonis Radix were retrieved from Web of Science(WoS) and CNKI, and the
      research institutions, journals, and keywords involved were visualized and
      analyzed using the scientometric software CiteSpace. The co-occurrence network of
      related research on Ophiopogonis Radix was constructed, and the Ophiopogonis
      Radix-disease-target network was plotted using Cytoscape 3.8.2. The hot topics in
      Chinese and English papers were analyzed and the shortcomings in the research on 
      Ophiopogonis Radix were summed up. Furthermore, the development trends were
      discussed. A total of 1 403 Chinese papers and 292 English papers were included
      in this study. The analysis of research institutions showed that Beijing
      University of Chinese Medicine and China Pharmaceutical University were the two
      research institutions with the largest numbers of papers published. The analysis 
      of journals showed that Hebei Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Journal
      of Asian Natural Products Research were the two journals with the highest numbers
      of papers concerning Ophiopogonis Radix. The keyword analysis showed that the
      research contents of Chinese papers focused on the analysis of medication
      regularity and clinical observation trials, while the English papers focused on
      component analysis and pharmacological investigation. Data mining and
      apoptosis-based pharmacological mechanism might be the research trends in the
      future.

AB  - This bibliometric analysis aimed to identify active research areas and trends in 
      machine learning applications within the psychiatric literature. An exponential
      growth in the number of related publications indexed in Web of Science during the
      last decade was noted. Document co-citation analysis revealed 10 clusters of
      knowledge, which included several mental health conditions, albeit with visible
      structural overlap. Several influential publications in the co-citation network
      were identified. Keyword trends illustrated a recent shift of focus from
      "psychotic" to "neurotic" conditions. Despite a relative lack of literature from 
      the developing world, a recent rise in publications from Asian countries was
      observed. DATA AVAILABILITY: Bibliographic data for this study were downloaded
      from the Web of Science. The search strategy is included in the Supplementary
      file.

      Combination Therapy in Cancer.
PG  - e2100109
LID - 10.1200/CCI.21.00109 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Despite advances in molecular therapeutics, few anticancer agents
      achieve durable responses. Rational combinations using two or more anticancer
      drugs have the potential to achieve a synergistic effect and overcome drug
      resistance, enhancing antitumor efficacy. A publicly accessible biomedical
      literature search engine dedicated to this domain will facilitate knowledge
      discovery and reduce manual search and review. METHODS: We developed RetriLite,
      an information retrieval and extraction framework that leverages natural language
      processing and domain-specific knowledgebase to computationally identify highly
      relevant papers and extract key information. The modular architecture enables
      RetriLite to benefit from synergizing information retrieval and natural language 
      processing techniques while remaining flexible to customization. We customized
      the application and created an informatics pipeline that strategically identifies
      papers that describe efficacy of using combination therapies in clinical or
      preclinical studies. RESULTS: In a small pilot study, RetriLite achieved an F1
      score of 0.93. A more extensive validation experiment was conducted to determine 
      agents that have enhanced antitumor efficacy in vitro or in vivo with poly
      (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors: 95.9% of the papers determined to be relevant
      by our application were true positive and the application's feature of
      distinguishing a clinical paper from a preclinical paper achieved an accuracy of 
      97.6%. Interobserver assessment was conducted, which resulted in a 100%
      concordance. The data derived from the informatics pipeline have also been made
      accessible to the public via a dedicated online search engine with an intuitive
      user interface. CONCLUSION: RetriLite is a framework that can be applied to
      establish domain-specific information retrieval and extraction systems. The
      extensive and high-quality metadata tags along with keyword highlighting
      facilitate information seekers to more effectively and efficiently discover
      knowledge in the combination therapy domain.

TI  - The First Guillain-Barr? Syndrome After SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination in Taiwan.
PG  - 46-51
AB  - PURPOSE: Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is an immune-mediated disease of the
      peripheral nerves and could be fatal and has severe neurologic complications.
      This study herein reports the clinical course of the first patient of GBS after
      SARS-CoV-2 Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccination in Taiwan. CASE REPORT: A 38-year-old
      woman who presented with progressive numbness and weakness of both upper and
      lower limbs over 1 week. Ascending patterns was noted, and bilateral leg were
      more severe with diffused absence of deep tendon reflex. Clinical examination and
      investigation findings confirmed with the diagnosis of GBS. Deterioration of
      muscle power and respiratory failure had developed during the hospitalization.
      She had no common GBS predisposing history, but she had received her first
      SARS-CoV-2 Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccination intramuscularly 10 days prior to her
      symptoms. Clinical symptoms had much improved after double filtration
      plasmapheresis. CONCLUSION: Our case is the first case of GBS developed after
      AstraZeneca vaccine injection in Taiwan, presenting with atypical manifestation
      of early facial and bulbar involvement. The vaccination associated GBS should be 
      closely monitored as other safety profile, since it may result in respiratory
      failure and severe neurologic complications. Keyword: Guillain-Barre Syndrome,
      SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination.

TI  - Cefepime Induced Neurotoxicity Mimicking Clinical Presentation of Left Middle
      Cerebral Artery Infarction: A Case Report and Review of Literature.
PG  - 41-45
AB  - PURPOSE: Cefepime is a widely used antibiotic which was known to have
      neurotoxicity resulted from its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and a
      wide variety of symptoms had been documented. Here we reported a case of Cefepime
      induced neurotoxicity with rare presentation. The aim of this study was to
      improve the knowledge of this condition. CASE REPORT: A 89-year-old female with a
      history of ESRD (end stage renal disease) and superimposed acute cholecystitis
      was treated with Cefepime. She developed the symptoms of global aphasia, right
      hemiplegia, leftward eye deviation and abnormal plantar reflex at right foot,
      which resembled acute ischemic stroke at left MCA (middle cerebral artery), on
      the fourth day of Cefepime treatment. There was no evidence of acute infarction
      in MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of brain and EEG (electroencephalography)
      revealed NCSE (nonconvulsive status epilepticus). NCSE was suspected to be
      attributed to Cefepime-induced neurotoxicity. The patient's main risk factors
      were decreased renal clearance and incorrect dosing. Conslusion: Cefepime-induced
      neurotoxicity should be suspected in patients who developed neurologic symptoms
      after the administration of Cefepime. Emergent image study for excluding more
      commonly seen or critical etiologies and further evaluation with EEG were
      necessary. For those patients who have risk factors for Cefepime neurotoxicity,
      such as ESRD, TDM (therapeutic drug monitoring) may be useful in providing close 
      monitoring and preventing adverse effects associated with Cefepime treatment.

      Hormone Presenting as Hypercalcemia- Related Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy 
      syndrome: A Case Report.
PG  - 36-40
AB  - PURPOSE: Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) displayed various
      acute neurological symptoms. PRES is a rare presentation of hypercalcemia. Here
      we present a case with ectopic secretion of parathyroid hormone from
      neuroendocrine carcinoma of the endometrium presenting as hypercalcemia-related
      PRES. CASE REPORT: A 67-year-old woman presented with acute generalized
      tonic-clonic seizure followed by post-ictal confusion and neuropsychiatric
      behaviors. The diagnosis is PRES. Investigations showed uterine cervical region
      with multiple liver metastasis complicated with hypercalcemia, elevated intact
      parathyroid hormone. Further pathology concluded as a poorly differentiated
      adenocarcinoma of the endometrium with neuroendocrine differentiation and
      immunoreactive for PTH. The patient's neurologic manifestations had resolved.
      Serum free calcium level and intact-PTH had declined after first course of
      definitive chemoradiation. CONCLUSION: Immunostaining of the tumor tissue can be 
      used to estimate the ectopic PTH production within the tumor cells. Early
      detection and appropriate clinical treatment hold the potential to improve the
      prognosis of refractory hypercalcemia and hypercalcemia related PRES. Keyword:

PG  - 15-23
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Neurofibromatosis is one of the most common dominantly inherited
      genetic disorders. This study aimed to study the demographic and clinical profile
      of neurofibromatosis patients. METHODS: This study is cross-sectional conducted
      in 2020 on the population of patients with neurofibromatosis. Patients who are
      members of the Neurofibromatosis Association answered the online demographic and 
      clinical information questionnaire. RESULTS: 446 patients with neurofibromatosis 
      participated in this study with a mean age of 33.39 plus or minus 12.87 years.
      297 patients (66.6%) were women and 378 (84.8%) patients had type 1
      neurofibromatosis. The disease visibility was reported to be moderate in 254
      patients (54.9%) and the severity of the disease was mild in 238 (53.4%)
      patients. The type of neurofibromatosis was not significantly related to gender, 
      age groups, parental education, and ethnicity. The relationship between severity 
      and age (p is equal to less than 0.001) and gender (p is equal to 0.042) was
      significant and the relationship between visibility and age (p is equal to less
      than 0.001) was significant but despite the fact that the disease was more
      visible in men than women, it was not significantly related to gender.
      CONCLUSIONS: The study results showed that the most common complication in the
      study population was Cafe au lait spot. In addition, visibility and severity of
      the disease were mild and moderate, respectively. Keyword: Neurofibromatosis,

      Northeast Iran.
PG  - 7-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune and multi-factorial (e.g.
      environmental, genetic) disease. We conducted a case-control study of month and
      season of birth (MOB and SOB) and multiple sclerosis (MS) risk in the east of
      Iran. METHODS: The MS patients registered in Mashhad and Torbat Heydariyeh MS
      Society until 20 March 2018 was compared with the MOB and SOB in the healthy
      population during 1988 to 2018. Case group was matched for age, sex and place of 
      residence with the control group. Differences in the distributions of MOB and SOB
      between the patients and the control groups were assessed using the chi-square
      test. RESULTS: There were 2,160 MS patients in case group and 2,245 in control
      group. There was a significant relationship between MOB ans SOB with the risk of 
      MS (P less than 0.05). Analysis showed a significant (p less than 0.01) peak in
      the MOB during Mar-Apr (OR is equal to 1.60), May-Jun (OR is equal to 1.30) and
      Aug-Sep (OR is equal to 2.42). CONCLUSION: The findings show a relationship
      between MOB and SOB as risk factor for MS in Northeast Iran. Further studies are 
      needed to confirm this result. Keyword: Multiple sclerosis, Month of Birth,

TI  - A bibliometric analysis of infectious diseases in patients with liver
      transplantation in the last decade.
PG  - 1646
LID - 10.21037/atm-21-2388 [doi]
AB  - Background: A bibliometric analysis was performed to reveal the current status of
      investigations in infectious diseases in patients with liver transplantation (LT)
      and to prioritize future research needs. Methods: The present study
      comprehensively retrieved publications relevant to infectious diseases in LT
      recipients published between 2010 and 2020. The search was conducted on the Web
      of Science (WoS) database. A bibliometric analysis was conducted through machine 
      learning and visualization tools, including VOSviewer, Bibliographic Item
      Co-Occurrence Matrix Builder, and Graphical Clustering Toolkit. Research hotspots
      and trends in the field were assessed, while the contributions and collaborations
      of countries, institutions, and authors were documented. Results: A total of 691 
      publications were analyzed. Research output sharply increased in 2015, with a
      fast drop afterward. "Liver transplantation" was the most frequent keyword, with 
      strong links to "hepatitis C virus" and "infection". Study areas included risk
      factors of infectious diseases in LT recipients, pathogens causing
      post-transplantation infections, antibacterial therapy and prophylaxis for
      peritransplant infection complications, living donor LT, and pediatric LT. The
      efficacy and safety of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for hepatitis C virus
      (HCV) infection among liver transplant recipients has attracted recent research
      interest. Didier Samuel was the most productive author, while Xavier Forns was
      the top-cited author. Shanghai Jiao Tong University was the most productive
      contributor, and Gilead Sciences was the most cited organization. Moreover, the
      USA was the greatest contributor. Gastroenterology was the most cited journal,
      while Liver Transplantation was the most prolific journal. Conclusions: This
      bibliometric analysis will better understand the research status of infectious
      complications in LT recipients and forecast future research trends. Priority
      should be given to identifying risk factors for peritransplantation infections
      and effective treatments against infectious complications in the coming years.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To consider a one-year time window of the COVID-19 crisis to
      integrate qualitative and quantitative data and provide an in-depth analysis of
      all COVID-19 publications from geographical, epidemiological and chronological
      perspectives. METHODS: Publications on COVID-19 from December 1, 2019, to
      December 31, 2020 without document type limitations were extracted from the Web
      of Science database. Microsoft Excel 2016, GraphPad Prism 9, VOSviewer 1.6.15 and
      IBM SPSS 21.0 were used to analyze the global epidemiological publication
      landscape and its correlations, research hotspots around the world and the top 5 
      countries in terms of publications. RESULTS: A total of 51,317 documents were
      analyzed in the present study. The publication trend could be divided into an
      increasing output stage and an explosive output stage. There were positive
      correlations between monthly publications, confirmed cases and deaths. Research
      hotspots from the whole year, from individual quarters, and from the top 5
      countries with the most publications were further identified. CONCLUSIONS: The
      correlation analysis of publications indicated that confirmed cases and deaths
      were forces driving the scientific output, reflecting the growing trend to some
      extent. Moreover, the hotspot analysis provided valuable information for
      scientists, funders, policy and decision-makers to determine what areas should be
      their focus when faced with public health emergencies in the future.

AB  - CONTEXT: Stroke is an illness with high morbidity, disability and mortality that 
      presents a major clinical challenge. Sanhua decoction (SHD) has been widely used 
      to treat ischaemic stroke in the clinic. However, the potential mechanism of SHD 
      remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the multitarget mechanism of SHD in
      ischaemic stroke through network pharmacology and bioinformatics analyses.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Network pharmacology and experimental validation approach 
      was used to investigate the bioactive ingredients, critical targets and potential
      mechanisms of SHD against ischaemic stroke. Four herbal names of SHD, 'ischemic
      stroke' or 'stroke' was used as a keyword to search the relevant databases.
      SH-SY5Y cells were treated with various concentrations of SHD (12.5, 25, 50 or
      100 mug/mL) for 4 h, exposed to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) for 1 h,
      then reoxygenation for 24 h. The cell viability was detected by MTT, the lactate 
      dehydrogenase (LDH) was evaluated by ELISA, and protein expression was detected
      by western blots. RESULTS: SHD treatment increased the survival rate from 65.9
      +/- 4.3 to 85.56 +/- 5.7%. The median effective dose (ED50) was 47.1 mug/mL, the 
      LDH decreased from 288.0 +/- 12.0 to 122.8 +/- 9.1 U/L and the cell apoptosis
      rate decreased from 33.6 +/- 1.8 to 16.3 +/- 1.2%. Western blot analysis revealed
      that SHD increased the levels of p-PI3k, p-Akt and p-CREB1, and decreased the
      expression of TNF-alpha and IL-6. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests
      that SHD protects against cerebral ischaemic injury via regulation of the
      PI3K/Akt/CREB1 and TNF pathways.

AB  - To verify brain and spinal changes using magnetic resonance imaging in patients
      with HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis. This was a
      systematic review. The descriptors used were tropical spastic paraparesis and
      magnetic resonance image. The keyword HTLV-1-associated myelopathy was also used.
      Twenty-three articles were included: 16 detected brain changes and 18 detected
      spinal changes. White matter lesions were the most frequent finding in the brain.
      Brain injuries were most frequently identified in the periventricular region, in 
      the subcortical region, in the centrum semiovale, in the brain stem, and corpus
      callosum. Atrophy was the most frequent finding of the spinal cord, affecting the
      thoracic and cervical regions, and was associated with a longer evolution of
      myelopathy. White matter lesions in these regions were also observed. Cortical
      white matter lesions and thoracic spinal cord atrophy were the most frequently
      reported changes in patients with HTLV-1-associated myelopathy.

TI  - Sharing health information across online platforms: A systematic review.
PG  - 1-13
LID - 10.1080/10410236.2021.2019920 [doi]
AB  - Advanced Web 2.0 communication technologies have facilitated health-related
      information (HRI) sharing on the Internet. Especially, the COVID-19 pandemic and 
      lockdowns around the world have forced more people to turn to the Internet for
      HRI. A better understanding of users' sharing content and sharing behavior can
      help communicators improve health literacy, raise community awareness, and
      facilitate social support exchanges. This paper reports the results of a
      systematic review of online HRI sharing literature, including key research
      topics, theories and methods used in past studies, and key factors of sharing
      behavior across online platforms. Following the PRISMA procedure for a systematic
      review, 58 articles were identified and analyzed using keyword matching, thematic
      analysis, and expert review. Guided by the platform theory, our findings
      differentiated five types of online platforms that differently influenced online 
      users' sharing content and sharing purposes, including micro-blogs, social
      network sites, online health communities, social question and answer sites, and
      Wikis. The findings also clarify five main research topics and applicable
      theories used in each topic, including personal health sharing, health-related
      knowledge sharing, general health message diffusion, outcomes of HRI sharing, and
      exploratory research. Key factors of sharing behavior and potential sharing
      outcomes are also reviewed and summarized in the research framework developed
      from the motivation theory. Our study contributes to the understanding of online 
      sharing behavior and provides implications for health communicators to develop
      effective health campaigns. Potential research directions are also identified and
      discussed.

TI  - Provider documentation of electronic nicotine delivery systems use among patients
      prescribed contraception at an academic health center in the Southeastern United 
      States.
PG  - 101632
LID - 10.1016/j.pmedr.2021.101632 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Women on combined hormonal contraception (CHC) who use electronic
      nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) may be vulnerable to adverse cardiovascular
      events. To date, no study has examined whether clinicians screen for ENDS use
      when prescribing CHC. Therefore, we investigated documentation of ENDS screening 
      and counseling in the electronic health record (EHR) of women prescribed CHC.
      Methods: We conducted a retrospective EHR review and content analysis at an
      academic health center in the Southeastern United States. We randomly selected
      500 records of female patients 12 years and older who had been prescribed
      contraception and had ENDS documented in their records identified via keyword
      match. Records prior to July 2020 were reviewed between June-September 2020.
      Results: Of the 500 patients, 245 (49%) were ENDS users and 227 (45.4%) were
      non-ENDS users. Among ENDS users, there were 82 contraception-related encounters 
      with ENDS documentation. In 55 (67.1%) of these encounters, only ENDS use status 
      was documented. The provider counseled against ENDS use in 17 (20.7%) records.
      Six (7.3%) notes documented provision of patient education materials instructing 
      patients on contraception to refrain from using ENDS. Among non-ENDS users, there
      were 43 contraception-related encounters with ENDS documentation; 35 (81.4%)
      documented the patient did not use ENDS and 3 (7%) documented provision of
      patient education materials. Conclusion: ENDS use is under-documented in
      contraception-related encounters. Improvements in documentation may help assess
      long-term effects of concurrent ENDS and CHC use. These results illustrate the
      need to clarify EHR prompts and increase provider awareness to improve ENDS
      documentation.

      CiteSpace.
PG  - 759347
LID - 10.3389/fpsyg.2021.759347 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate the global scientific output of research on
      pain catastrophizing and explore the hotspots and frontiers from 2010 to 2020
      using bibliometric methods. Methods: Publications regarding pain catastrophizing 
      published from 2010 to 2020 were extracted from the Web of Science Core
      Collection. CiteSpace was used to analyze the number of publications, countries, 
      institutions, journals, authors, cited references, and keywords using standard
      bibliometric indicators. Results: A total of 1,576 publications on pain
      catastrophizing were retrieved from 2010 to December 31, 2020. The number and
      rate of the annual publications gradually increased totally. Pain (130) was the
      most productive journal. Meanwhile, Pain ranked first in the frequency (1,432)
      and centrality (0.31) of the cited journals. The most productive country and
      institution in this frequency field were the United States (642) and the
      University of Washington (73), respectively. Jensen MP (34) was the most prolific
      author, and Sullivan MJL (1,196) ranked first among the cited authors. In the
      ranking of frequency in the cited references, the first article was a critical
      review about pain catastrophizing published by Quartana (100). The keyword "Low
      back pain" had the highest frequency (556). "Total hip" was identified as a
      frontier research item for 2016-2020. Conclusion: The findings of this
      bibliometric study provide the current status and trends in the clinical research
      of pain catastrophizing and may help researchers to identify hot topics and
      explore new research directions in this field.

TI  - Science maps for exploration, navigation, and reflection-A graphic approach to
      strategic thinking.
PG  - e0262081

AB  - The world of science is growing at an unprecedented speed with more and more
      scholarly papers produced each year. The scientific landscape is constantly
      changing as research specialties evolve, merge or become obsolete. It is
      difficult for researchers, research managers and the public alike to keep abreast
      with these changes and maintain a true and fair overview of the world of science.
      Such an overview is necessary to stimulate scientific progress, to maintain
      flexible and responsive research organizations, and to secure collaboration and
      knowledge exchange between different research specialties and the wider
      community. Although science mapping is applied to a wide range of scientific
      areas, examples of their practical use are sparse. This paper demonstrates how to
      use a topical, scientific reference maps to understand and navigate in dynamic
      research landscapes and how to utilize science maps to facilitate strategic
      thinking. In this study, the research domain of biology at Aarhus University
      serves as an example. All scientific papers authored by the current, permanent
      staff were extracted (6,830 in total). These papers were used to create a
      semantic cognitive map of the research field using a co-word analysis based on
      keywords and keyword phrases. A workflow was written in Python for easy and fast 
      retrieval of information for topic maps (including tokens from keywords section
      and title) to generate intelligible research maps, and to visualize the
      distribution of topics (keywords), papers, journal categories, individual
      researchers and research groups on any scale. The resulting projections revealed 
      new insights into the structure of the research community and made it possible to
      compare researchers or research groups to describe differences and similarities, 
      to find scientific overlaps or gaps, and to understand how they relate and
      connect. Science mapping can be used for intended (top-down) as well as emergent 
      (bottom-up) strategy development. The paper concludes that science maps provide
      alternative views of the intricate structures of science to supplement
      traditional bibliometric information. These insights may help strengthen
      strategic thinking and boost creativity and thus contribute to the progress of
      science.

TI  - Glymphatic System Dysfunction in Mild Traumatic Brain Injury.
PG  - S24-S25
LID - 10.1212/01.wnl.0000801968.87371.4e [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical role of the glymphatic system in mild traumatic
      brain injury (mTBI) and post-concussive syndrome (PCS). BACKGROUND: Clinical
      manifestations of mTBI, or concussion, involve a wide array of cognitive,
      behavioral, and mechanical impairments that commonly spontaneously resolve within
      weeks. When these symptoms persist, it defines a class of mTBI known as
      post-concussive syndrome. A multifaceted approach for diagnosing concussion and
      PCS, heavily reliant on a neurocognitive screening, has become the standard in
      suspected cases. Conventional imaging protocols are occasionally implemented for 
      exclusion of structural injury, rarely revealing substantial evidence in
      otherwise uncomplicated mTBI. A CNS-specific lymphatic network, termed
      glymphatic, has shown to play a critical role in immune surveillance and drainage
      of cellular debris. Moreover, recent evidence points to glymphatic dysfunction in
      TBI, including mild cases, as its anatomical layout becomes better understood.
      Here, we review the current literature on glymphatic function and imaging
      modalities, with an emphasis on implications in mTBI. DESIGN/METHODS: Literature 
      was compiled primarily using various keyword searches (glymphatic + imaging,
      meningeal lymphatics, glymphatic + concussion, etc.) via Pubmed and the NIH/NLM
      archive. Inclusion criteria involved limiting to studies on human patients or
      tissue. RESULTS: The glymphatic system displays critical function in healthy
      patients and in disease, with activity that suggests a diurnal sleep-cycle.
      Advanced imaging methodologies, most notably, the use of various MRI techniques, 
      have identified impairments in meningeal lymphatic dysfunction in TBI, however,
      the clinical application of glymphatic imaging has yet to be well-studied and
      shows challenges in providing definitive data. Nonetheless, the potential for
      glymphatic imaging to expand our understanding of mTBI and PCS warrants further
      investigation. CONCLUSIONS: Anatomical and functional properties of the
      glymphatic network make an appealing target for concussion diagnosis, observing
      recovery, and exposing impact-related microstructural injuries, however the
      implementation of imaging in a clinical setting has yet to be well-characterized.

TI  - Coping with Hypertension among Indigenous Peoples in Brazil and the Role of the
      Primary Care Nurse: A Critical Review from a Transcultural Perspective.
PG  - 942-954
LID - 10.3390/nursrep11040086 [doi]
AB  - Our objective is to critically review the literature addressing the strategic
      role of nurses in the daily primary care of arterial hypertension in Indigenous
      communities in Brazil. We selected studies based on an initial keyword search of 
      major bibliographic indexing databases for the years 2000 to 2020 and manual
      search. Further selection was based on topical, methodological, and thematic
      relevance, as well as evaluation of scholarship quality and pertinence to our
      chosen narrative. The literature demonstrates Indigenous peoples do not receive
      health services that measure up to national standards in large part due to a
      marked lack of academic and employer preparation for nurses operating in
      transcultural settings. Inequities were apparent in recurrent reports of
      victim-blaming, deficient clinical communication with patients, clinical
      malpractice, devaluation of hypertension as a problem for Indigenous peoples,
      insufficient intercultural training for nurses, and discrimination against
      Indigenous students in nursing education programs. This systemic problem needs to
      be addressed by universities and the Indigenous Health Care Subsystem in Brazil.

TI  - Autobiographical memory impairments as a transdiagnostic feature of mental
      illness: A meta-analytic review of investigations into autobiographical memory
      specificity and overgenerality among people with psychiatric diagnoses.
PG  - 1054-1074
LID - 10.1037/bul0000345 [doi]
AB  - Decades of research has examined the difficulty that people with psychiatric
      diagnoses have in recalling specific autobiographical memories of events that
      lasted less than a day. Instead, they seem to retrieve general events that have
      occurred many times or which occurred over longer periods of time, termed
      overgeneral memory. We present the first transdiagnostic meta-analysis of memory 
      specificity/overgenerality and the first meta-regression of proposed causal
      mechanisms. A keyword search of Embase, PsycARTICLES, and PsycINFO databases
      yielded 74 studies that compared people with and without psychiatric diagnoses on
      the retrieval of specific (k = 85) or general memories (k = 56). The majority of 
      studies included participants with Major Depressive Disorder ( approximately
      49%), Schizophrenia ( approximately 19%), and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (
      approximately 17%) with few studies involving other groups of participants, for
      example, Anxiety Disorders ( approximately 5%). Multilevel meta-analysis
      confirmed that people with psychiatric diagnoses typically recall fewer specific,
      g = -0.864, 95% CI [-1.030, -0.698], and more general, g = 712, 95% CI [0.524,
      0.900], memories than diagnoses-free people. The size of these effects did not
      differ between diagnostic groups. There were no consistent moderators of effect
      size heterogeneity; effect sizes were not explained by methodological factors
      such as cue valence or demographic variables such as participants' age or
      between-group differences in process variables (e.g., rumination). Deficits in
      autobiographical memory retrieval may be a transdiagnostic factor, but further
      research in underrepresented diagnostic groups, and with novel experimental
      manipulations of encoding and retrieval processes, is warranted before full
      transdiagnosticity and the processes underlying reduced
      specificity/overgenerality can be established. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022

TI  - Systematic online academic resource (SOAR) review: Endocrine, metabolic, and
      nutritional disorders.
PG  - e10716
LID - 10.1002/aet2.10716 [doi]
AB  - Background: Free open-access medical education (FOAM) has become an integral
      resource for medical school and residency education. However, questions of
      quality and inconsistent coverage of core topics remain. In this second entry of 
      the SAEM Systematic Online Academic Resource (SOAR) series, we describe the
      application of a systematic methodology to identify, curate, and describe FOAM
      topics specific to endocrine, metabolic, and nutritional disorders as defined by 
      the 2016 Model of the Clinical Practice of Emergency Medicine (MCPEM). Methods:
      We developed an automated algorithm to search 264 keywords derived from nine
      subtopics within the MCPEM category in the FOAM Search (a customized FOAM search 
      tool) and the Social Media index. The top 100 results were extracted for each
      keyword. Resources underwent a manual iterative screening process, and those
      relevant to endocrine, metabolic, or nutritional disorders and EM were evaluated 
      with the revised Medical Education Translational Resources: Impact and Quality
      (rMETRIQ) tool. Results: The search yielded 36,346 resources, of which 756 met
      the criteria for quality assessment. After rMETRIQ tool training, four raters
      demonstrated an average measured intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.94 (95% 
      confidence interval = 0.88 to 0.97, p < 0.001). A total of 121 posts (16% of
      posts) covering 25 subtopics were identified as high quality (rMETRIQ >/=16). The
      most covered subtopic was potassium disorders, representing 15% of all posts.
      Subtopics that did not have a high-quality resource identified include metabolic 
      alkalosis, respiratory alkalosis, fluid overload, phosphorus metabolism,
      hyperglycemia, malabsorption, malnutrition, and thyroiditis. From most to least
      common, the overall target audience was junior resident (91%), PGY-1 resident
      (88%), senior resident (81%), clerk (64%), attending (50%), and preclerkship
      (9%). Conclusions: We systematically identified, described, and curated FOAM
      resources for EM learners on the topic of endocrine, metabolic, and nutritional
      disorders. A final list of high-quality resources can guide trainees, educator
      recommendations, and FOAM authors.

TI  - Clinical Prediction Models for Hepatitis B Virus-related Acute-on-chronic Liver
      Failure: A Technical Report.
PG  - 838-849
LID - 10.14218/JCTH.2021.00005 [doi]
AB  - Background and Aims: It is critical but challenging to predict the prognosis of
      hepatitis B virus-related acute-on-chronic liver failure (HBV-ACLF). This study
      systematically summarized and evaluated the quality and performance of available 
      clinical prediction models (CPMs). Methods: A keyword search of articles on
      HBV-ACLF CPMs published in PubMed from January 1995 to April 2020 was performed. 
      Both the quality and performance of the CPMs were assessed. Results: Fifty-two
      CPMs were identified, of which 31 were HBV-ACLF specific. The modeling data were 
      mostly derived from retrospective (83.87%) and single-center (96.77%) cohorts,
      with sample sizes ranging from 46 to 1,202. Three-month mortality was the most
      common endpoint. The Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver
      consensus (51.92%) and Chinese Medical Association liver failure guidelines
      (40.38%) were commonly used for HBV-ACLF diagnosis. Serum bilirubin (67.74%), the
      international normalized ratio (54.84%), and hepatic encephalopathy (51.61%) were
      the most frequent variables used in models. Model discrimination was commonly
      evaluated (88.46%), but model calibration was seldom performed. The model for
      end-stage liver disease score was the most widely used (84.62%); however, varying
      performance was reported among the studies. Conclusions: Substantial limitations 
      lie in the quality of HBV-ACLF-specific CPMs. Disease severity of study
      populations may impact model performance. The clinical utility of CPMs in
      predicting short-term prognosis of HBV-ACLF remains to be undefined.

TI  - Strategies of Elicitation to Enhance Bioactive Compound Content in Edible Plant
      Sprouts: A Bibliometric Study.
LID - 2759 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/plants10122759 [doi]
AB  - Vegetable sprouts are a food source that presents high content of bioactive
      compounds which can also be enhanced through elicitation mechanisms. To better
      understand the scientific production and research trends on this topic, a
      bibliometric analysis by means of the Web of Science database was carried out.
      The results showed significant growth in research on the elicitation of edible
      plants sprouts. The three most productive journals were the Journal of
      Agricultural and Food Chemistry, followed by Food Chemistry and LWT-Food Science 
      and Technology. The co-occurrence of keyword analysis of the different authors
      showed that the main research topics in this domain were 'germination',
      'antioxidant activity', 'sprouts', 'glucosinolates' and 'phenolics'. The
      countries with the highest number of scientific publications were China, followed
      by India and USA. The productivity patterns of the authors conformed to Lotka's
      law. This study provides an overview of research on elicitation to enrich
      bioactive compounds in sprouts, and the need to review and update the trends on
      this subject.

TI  - Generalisation Gap of Keyword Spotters in a Cross-Speaker Low-Resource Scenario.
LID - 8313 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s21248313 [doi]
AB  - Models for keyword spotting in continuous recordings can significantly improve
      the experience of navigating vast libraries of audio recordings. In this paper,
      we describe the development of such a keyword spotting system detecting regions
      of interest in Polish call centre conversations. Unfortunately, in spite of
      recent advancements in automatic speech recognition systems, human-level
      transcription accuracy reported on English benchmarks does not reflect the
      performance achievable in low-resource languages, such as Polish. Therefore, in
      this work, we shift our focus from complete speech-to-text conversion to acoustic
      similarity matching in the hope of reducing the demand for data annotation. As
      our primary approach, we evaluate Siamese and prototypical neural networks
      trained on several datasets of English and Polish recordings. While we obtain
      usable results in English, our models' performance remains unsatisfactory when
      applied to Polish speech, both after mono- and cross-lingual training. This
      performance gap shows that generalisation with limited training resources is a
      significant obstacle for actual deployments in low-resource languages. As a
      potential countermeasure, we implement a detector using audio embeddings
      generated with a generic pre-trained model provided by Google. It has a much more
      favourable profile when applied in a cross-lingual setup to detect Polish audio
      patterns. Nevertheless, despite these promising results, its performance on
      out-of-distribution data are still far from stellar. It would indicate that, in
      spite of the richness of internal representations created by more generic models,
      such speech embeddings are not entirely malleable to cross-language transfer.

TI  - Global Public Interest and Seasonal Variations in Alzheimer's Disease: Evidence
      From Google Trends.
PG  - 778930
LID - 10.3389/fmed.2021.778930 [doi]
AB  - Background: As the world's population ages, Alzheimer's disease (AD), a common
      neurodegenerative disease, is a major challenge to human health in the future.
      Understanding the information needs on AD of the global public can contribute to 
      the prevention and control of AD. The purpose of this study was to explore global
      public interest and seasonal variations in AD using Google Trends (GT). Methods: 
      GT was used to obtain relative search volume (RSV) of the keyword "Alzheimer's
      disease" in six English-speaking countries (Australia, New Zealand, the USA, the 
      UK, Canada, and Ireland) and the world from January 2004 to December 2020.
      Cosinor analysis was applied to detect the seasonality of AD-related RSV. Time
      series plot was used to observe the trend of annual mean AD-related RSV.
      Globally, hot topics and top rising topics related to AD were also analyzed. In
      addition, we also explored the geographical distribution characteristics of
      AD-related RSV. Results: AD-related RSV declined steadily from January 2004 to
      December 2013 and rose steadily from January 2014 to December 2020. Search
      popularity of AD is low in the southern hemisphere, compared to the northern
      hemisphere. Cosinor analysis showed that there were significant seasonal
      variations in AD-related RSV in six English-speaking countries (all P < 0.05).
      Interestingly, regardless of the hemisphere, peaks were observed in the winter
      months and trough in the summer months. Topics related to the characteristics and
      etiology of AD, early onset AD, AD-related associations, care of AD patients, and
      diseases that can easily be confused with AD had received special attention.
      Conclusions: There is increasing global public interest for AD and a significant 
      seasonal variation in AD. A better understanding of the seasonal variations and
      public interest of AD by governments, health workers and patients can contribute 
      to the prevention, management, and treatment of AD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The desire to understand and the growing interest in research on the 
      effects of kangaroo mother care in preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care
      unit have led to a significant increase in the number of manuscripts published in
      this field over the past decade. It is therefore necessary to regularly review
      the state of knowledge on this phenomenon in order to identify progress and
      constraints, to stimulate reflection, and to encourage progress in future
      research. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the current state of
      scientific production in relation to kangaroo mother care in preterm infants in
      the neonatal intensive care unit through bibliometric analysis. DATA SOURCES:
      This study presents a review of 212 published papers from the Scopus database
      (1990-2019). DATA EXTRACTION: Two processing software applications were used:
      VOSviewer and SciMAT. In addition, through a keyword analysis, this study
      established the hot spot research trends to be developed in future work. The
      study adhered to the PRISMA-ScR guidelines for quality improvement studies as
      part of the EQUATOR network. RESULTS: Our results show that research in this
      field is going through a time of high productivity and we could sort this growing
      body of work into different periods, highlighting the most important topics.The
      analysis shows that most research in this field is focused on five motor topics. 
      These are: prematurity, male, psychology, intensive care neonatal, and major
      clinical study. The analysis also allowed us to identify four basic and
      cross-disciplinary topics that need to be developed and that emerge as future
      research directions: preterm infants, child-parent relations, child development, 
      and skin-to-skin contact. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE AND RESEARCH: The main
      contribution of this work is the creation of a knowledge map on the research in
      this field. This article provides information on how we can shape the future to
      provide optimal care for these infants and their parents.

TI  - Medical and Health-Related Misinformation on Social Media: Bibliometric Study of 
      the Scientific Literature.
PG  - e28152
LID - 10.2196/28152 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Social media has been extensively used for the communication of
      health-related information and consecutively for the potential spread of medical 
      misinformation. Conventional systematic reviews have been published on this topic
      to identify original articles and to summarize their methodological approaches
      and themes. A bibliometric study could complement their findings, for instance,
      by evaluating the geographical distribution of the publications and determining
      if they were well cited and disseminated in high-impact journals. OBJECTIVE: The 
      aim of this study was to perform a bibliometric analysis of the current
      literature to discover the prevalent trends and topics related to medical
      misinformation on social media. METHODS: The Web of Science Core Collection
      electronic database was accessed to identify relevant papers with the following
      search string: ALL=(misinformati* OR "wrong informati*" OR disinformati* OR
      "misleading informati*" OR "fake news*") AND ALL=(medic* OR illness* OR disease* 
      OR health* OR pharma* OR drug* OR therap*) AND ALL=("social media*" OR Facebook* 
      OR Twitter* OR Instagram* OR YouTube* OR Weibo* OR Whatsapp* OR Reddit* OR
      TikTok* OR WeChat*). Full records were exported to a bibliometric software,
      VOSviewer, to link bibliographic information with citation data. Term and keyword
      maps were created to illustrate recurring terms and keywords. RESULTS: Based on
      an analysis of 529 papers on medical and health-related misinformation on social 
      media, we found that the most popularly investigated social media platforms were 
      Twitter (n=90), YouTube (n=67), and Facebook (n=57). Articles targeting these 3
      platforms had higher citations per paper (>13.7) than articles covering other
      social media platforms (Instagram, Weibo, WhatsApp, Reddit, and WeChat; citations
      per paper <8.7). Moreover, social media platform-specific papers accounted for
      44.1% (233/529) of all identified publications. Investigations on these platforms
      had different foci. Twitter-based research explored cyberchondria and
      hypochondriasis, YouTube-based research explored tobacco smoking, and
      Facebook-based research studied vaccine hesitancy related to autism. COVID-19 was
      a common topic investigated across all platforms. Overall, the United States
      contributed to half of all identified papers, and 80% of the top 10 most
      productive institutions were based in this country. The identified papers were
      mostly published in journals of the categories public environmental and
      occupational health, communication, health care sciences services, medical
      informatics, and medicine general internal, with the top journal being the
      Journal of Medical Internet Research. CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant
      platform-specific topic preference for social media investigations on medical
      misinformation. With a large population of internet users from China, it may be
      reasonably expected that Weibo, WeChat, and TikTok (and its Chinese version
      Douyin) would be more investigated in future studies. Currently, these platforms 
      present research gaps that leave their usage and information dissemination
      warranting further evaluation. Future studies should also include social
      platforms targeting non-English users to provide a wider global perspective.

TI  - Knowledge Mapping of Research on Land Use Change and Food Security: A Visual
      Analysis Using CiteSpace and VOSviewer.
LID - 13065 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph182413065 [doi]
AB  - Many scholars have conducted in-depth research on the theme of land use change
      and food security, and formed fruitful research results, but there is a lack of
      quantitative analysis and comprehensive evaluation of research achievements.
      Therefore, based on the relevant literature on the theme of land use change and
      food security in the core collection of the Web of Science (WOS) database, this
      paper takes the advantage of CiteSpace and VOSviewer bibliometric software to
      draw the cooperative network and keyword cooccurrence map to analyze the research
      progress and frontier. The results reveal that: (1) The research started in 1999 
      and can be divided into three stages: initial research, rapid development, and a 
      stable in-depth stage. This topic has increasingly become a research hotspot in
      the academic community. (2) The distribution of research institutions is
      concentrated and forms a small cluster, and the research networks between
      developed and developing countries have been established, and developed countries
      are in the core position, but the cooperation network is not prominent. (3) The
      research content is becoming increasingly organized and systematic, and the
      research hot topics are divided into seven aspects. (4) The research area of the 
      subject covers multiple levels, such as global, national, and specific natural
      geographical regions, and has formed a research system of geographic information 
      technology and satellite remote sensing technology. It also presents the trend of
      cross integration with economics, land management and soil science. In the
      future, theoretical innovation still needs to be strengthened, and we should
      strengthen the research on the impact of agricultural chemical fertilizers on
      food security and study the impact of urban expansion on land use change.

TI  - Scientometric Analysis of Disaster Risk Perception: 2000-2020.
LID - 13003 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph182413003 [doi]
AB  - This paper used 1526 works from the literature on disaster risk perception from
      2000 to 2020 in the Web of Science core collection database as the research
      subject. The CiteSpace knowledge graph analysis tool was used to visual analyze
      the country, author, institution, discipline distribution, keywords, and keyword 
      clustering mapping. The paper drew the following conclusions. Firstly, disaster
      risk perception research has experienced three stages of steady development,
      undulating growth, and rapid growth. Secondly, the field of disaster risk
      perception was mainly concentrated in the disciplines of engineering, natural
      science, and management science. Thirdly, meteorological disasters, earthquakes, 
      nuclear radiation, and epidemics were the main disasters in the field of disaster
      risk perception. Residents and adolescents were the main subjects of research in 
      the field of disaster risk perception. Fourthly, research on human risk behavior 
      and risk psychology and research on disaster risk control and emergency
      management were two major research hotspots in the field of disaster risk
      perception. Finally, the research field of disaster risk perception is constantly
      expanding. There is a trend from theory to application and multi-perspective
      combination, and future research on disaster risk perception will be presented
      more systematically. The conclusion can provide a reference for disaster risk
      perception research, as well as directions for future research.

TI  - A Bibliometric Analysis of Atopic Dermatitis Research over the Past Three Decades
      and Future Perspectives.
LID - 1749 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/healthcare9121749 [doi]
AB  - Atopic dermatitis (AD) has been increasing in prevalence over the past few
      decades; however, AD has never been analyzed using a bibliometric approach. We
      searched for AD studies in the dermatology and allergy category of the Web of
      Science and SCOPUS databases using the keywords "atopic dermatitis", "eczema",
      and "atopy". In total, 53,460 documents were retrieved. We analyzed annual
      publication trends and performed keyword and co-authorship network analyses. The 
      annual number of AD publications has increased over the years. Asthma, food
      allergies, the skin barrier, IgE, and epidemiology have received extensive
      attention. The keywords 'allergic rhinitis', 'child(ren)', 'quality of life', and
      'probiotics' have become more commonly used in recent years. AD research has been
      led by only a few countries, such as the USA, Germany, and the UK, and
      longstanding research topics such as asthma, allergy, and the immune system
      continue to be important. We suggest that global collaborations, research in
      developing countries, and research that is more holistic (thus exploring how
      genes, the immune system, the environment, and the microbiome together impact AD)
      are necessary.

TI  - Antimicrobial Activity of Chemically and Biologically Treated Chitosan Prepared
      from Black Soldier Fly (Hermetia illucens) Pupal Shell Waste.

AB  - Globally, the broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity of chitin and chitosan has
      been widely documented. However, very little research attention has focused on
      chitin and chitosan extracted from black soldier fly pupal exuviae, which are
      abundantly present as byproducts from insect-farming enterprises. This study
      presents the first comparative analysis of chemical and biological extraction of 
      chitin and chitosan from BSF pupal exuviae. The antibacterial activity of
      chitosan was also evaluated. For chemical extraction, demineralization and
      deproteinization were carried out using 1 M hydrochloric acid at 100 degrees C
      for 2 h and 1 M NaOH for 4 h at 100 degrees C, respectively. Biological chitin
      extraction was carried out by protease-producing bacteria and
      lactic-acid-producing bacteria for protein and mineral removal, respectively. The
      extracted chitin was converted to chitosan via deacetylation using 40% NaOH for 8
      h at 100 degrees C. Chitin characterization was done using FTIR spectroscopy,
      while the antimicrobial properties were determined using the disc diffusion
      method. Chemical and biological extraction gave a chitin yield of 10.18% and
      11.85%, respectively. A maximum chitosan yield of 6.58% was achieved via chemical
      treatment. From the FTIR results, biological and chemical chitin showed
      characteristic chitin peaks at 1650 and 1550 cm(-1)-wavenumbers corresponding to 
      amide I stretching and amide II bending, respectively. There was significant
      growth inhibition for Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis,Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa,Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans when subjected to 2.5 and 
      5% concentrations of chitosan. Our findings demonstrate that chitosan from BSF
      pupal exuviae could be a promising and novel therapeutic agent for drug
      development against resistant strains of bacteria.

TI  - Value of the Electronic Medical Record for Hospital Care: Update From the
      Literature.
PG  - e26323
LID - 10.2196/26323 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronic records could improve quality and efficiency of health
      care. National and international bodies propagate this belief worldwide. However,
      the evidence base concerning the effects and advantages of electronic records is 
      questionable. The outcome of health care systems is influenced by many
      components, making assertions about specific types of interventions difficult.
      Moreover, electronic records itself constitute a complex intervention offering
      several functions with possibly positive as well as negative effects on the
      outcome of health care systems. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review is to summarize
      empirical studies about the value of electronic medical records (EMRs) for
      hospital care published between 2010 and spring 2019. METHODS: The authors
      adopted their method from a series of literature reviews. The literature search
      was performed on MEDLINE with "Medical Record System, Computerized" as the
      essential keyword. The selection process comprised 2 phases looking for a consent
      of both authors. Starting with 1345 references, 23 were finally included in the
      review. The evaluation combined a scoring of the studies' quality, a description 
      of data sources in case of secondary data analyses, and a qualitative assessment 
      of the publications' conclusions concerning the medical record's impact on
      quality and efficiency of health care. RESULTS: The majority of the studies
      stemmed from the United States (19/23, 83%). Mostly, the studies used publicly
      available data ("secondary data studies"; 17/23, 74%). A total of 18 studies
      analyzed the effect of an EMR on the quality of health care (78%), 16 the effect 
      on the efficiency of health care (70%). The primary data studies achieved a mean 
      score of 4.3 (SD 1.37; theoretical maximum 10); the secondary data studies a mean
      score of 7.1 (SD 1.26; theoretical maximum 9). From the primary data studies, 2
      demonstrated a reduction of costs. There was not one study that failed to
      demonstrate a positive effect on the quality of health care. Overall, 9/16
      respective studies showed a reduction of costs (56%); 14/18 studies showed an
      increase of health care quality (78%); the remaining 4 studies missed explicit
      information about the proposed positive effect. CONCLUSIONS: This review revealed
      a clear evidence about the value of EMRs. In addition to an awesome majority of
      economic advantages, the review also showed improvements in quality of care by
      all respective studies. The use of secondary data studies has prevailed over
      primary data studies in the meantime. Future work could focus on specific aspects
      of electronic records to guide their implementation and operation.

AB  - This study aimed to identify the relationships between the keywords of research
      on metabolic syndrome in cancer survivors and the entire knowledge research
      structure, through topic extraction from a macro perspective. From six electronic
      databases, 918 studies published between 1996 and 2019 were identified and
      reviewed, and 365 were included. Keyword network analysis and topic modeling were
      applied to examine the studies. In keyword network analysis, "obesity,"
      "treatment," "breast cancer," "body mass index," and "prostate cancer" were the
      major keywords, whereas "obesity" and "breast" were the dominant keywords and
      ranked high in frequency, degree centrality, and betweenness centrality. In topic
      modeling, five clustered topics emerged, namely metabolic syndrome component,
      post CTX(chemotherapy) sequence, prostate-specific antigen-sensitive plot,
      lifestyle formation, and insulin fluctuation. Topic 2, post CTX sequence, showed 
      the highest salience in earlier studies, but this has decreased over time, and
      the themes of the studies have also broadened. This study may provide critical
      basic data for determining the changing trends of research on metabolic syndrome 
      in cancer survivors and for predicting the direction of future research through
      the visualization of the effects and interactions between the major keywords in
      research on metabolic syndrome in cancer survivors.

TI  - Studies on Children With Developmental Coordination Disorder in the Past 20
      Years: A Bibliometric Analysis via CiteSpace.
PG  - 776883
LID - 10.3389/fpsyt.2021.776883 [doi]
AB  - Children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) have been commonly
      observed and drawn an increasing amount of attention over the past decades. The
      aim of the present study is to evaluate the origin, current hotspots, and
      research trends on children with DCD using a bibliometric tool. After searching
      with "children" and "developmental coordination disorder" as the "topic" and
      "title" words, respectively, 635 original articles with 12,559 references were
      obtained from the electronic databases, Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC).
      CiteSpace V.5.7.R2 was used to perform the analysis. The number of publications
      in this field was increasing over the past two decades. John Cairney from the
      Department of Family Medicine, McMaster University, Canada, was found to be the
      most productive researcher. Meanwhile, McMaster University and Canada were the
      most productive research institution and country, respectively. Reference and
      journal co-citation analyses revealed the top landmark articles and clusters in
      this field. Clumsiness was the most strength burst keyword. Moreover, task,
      meta-analysis, difficulty, adult, and impact will be the active research hotspots
      in future. These findings provide the trends and frontiers in the field of
      children with DCD, and valuable information for clinicians and scientists to
      identify new perspectives with potential collaborators and cooperative countries.

PG  - e19703
LID - 10.7759/cureus.19703 [doi]
AB  - Lumbar pneumorrhachis following head injury is rare and commonly asymptomatic but
      can be indicative of skull fracture and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, which may
      warrant intervention. A PubMed review of the literature was performed using a
      keyword search to identify cases examining lumbar pneumorrhachis following head
      injury. Our case series included two patients who had lumbar pneumorrhachis
      between September 2019 and May 2020 at our center. The literature review
      summarizes 16 patients from 14 prior reports of pneumorrhachis. In our
      two-patient case series, neither patient required direct intervention for either 
      pneumorrhachis or CSF leak. Pneumorrhachis is rare following an isolated head
      injury and is associated with basilar skull fractures and CSF leak.
      Pneumorrhachis should alert clinicians to the possibility of a CSF leak, which
      may require intervention.

TI  - Utilization of Automated Keyword Search to Identify E-Scooter Injuries in the
      Emergency Department.
PG  - e19539
LID - 10.7759/cureus.19539 [doi]
AB  - Background and objective Accurate identification and categorization of injuries
      from medical records can be challenging, yet it is important for injury
      epidemiology and prevention efforts. Coding systems such as the International
      Classification of Diseases (ICD) have well-known limitations. Utilizing
      computer-based techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) can help
      augment the identification and categorization of diseases in electronic health
      records. We used a Python program to search the text to identify cases of scooter
      injuries that presented to our emergency department (ED). Materials and methods
      This retrospective chart review was conducted between March 2017 and June 2019 in
      a single, urban academic ED with approximately 80,000 annual visits. The
      physician documentation was stored as combined PDF files by date. A Python
      program was developed to search the text from 186,987 encounters to find the
      string "scoot" and to extract the 100 characters before and after the phrase to
      facilitate a manual review of this subset of charts. Results A total of 890
      charts were identified using the Python program, of which 235 (26.4%) were
      confirmed as e-scooter cases. Patients had an average age of 36 years and 53%
      were male. In 81.7% of cases, the patients reported a fall from the scooter and
      only 1.7% reported wearing a helmet during the event. The most commonly injured
      body areas were the upper extremity (57.9%), head (42.1%), and lower extremity
      (36.2%). The most frequently consulted specialists were orthopedic and trauma
      surgeons with 28% of cases requiring a consult. In our population, 9.4% of
      patients required admission to the hospital. Conclusions The number of results
      and data returned by the Python program was easy to manage and made it easier to 
      identify charts for abstraction. The charts obtained allowed us to understand the
      nature and demographics of e-scooter injuries in our ED. E-scooters continue to
      be a popular mode of transportation, and understanding injury patterns related to
      them may inform and guide opportunities for policy and prevention.

      and/or gender minority families: Identifying existing strengths and areas of
      improvement.

AB  - Birth certificates are some of the most critical identity documents available to 
      current residents of the United States, yet sexual and gender minority (SGM)
      parents frequently face barriers in obtaining accurate documents for their
      children. It is essential for SGM parents to have accurate birth certificates for
      their children at the time of birth registration so that they do not experience
      undue burden in raising their children and establishing their status as legal
      parents. In this analysis, we focused on the birth registration process in the US
      as they apply to SGM family-building and the assignation of parentage on birth
      certificates at the time of a child's birth. We utilized keyword-based search
      criteria to identify, collect, and tabulate official state policies related to
      birth registration. Birth registration policies rely on gendered, heteronormative
      assumptions about the sex and gender of a child's parents in all but three states
      when identifying the birthing person and in all but eight states when identifying
      the non-birthing person. We found additional barriers for SGM parents who give
      birth outside of a marriage or legal union. These barriers leave SGM parents
      particularly vulnerable to inaccuracies on their children's identity documents
      and incomplete recognition of their parental roles and rights. Existing birth
      registration policies also do little to ensure the inclusion of diverse family
      structures in administrative data collection. There are many ways to modify
      existing birth registration policies and enhance the inclusion of SGM parents
      within governmental administrative structures. We conclude with suggestions to
      improve upon existing birth registration systems by de-linking parental sex and
      gender from birthing role, parental role, and contribution to the pregnancy.

AB  - We sought to analyze the existence of skin of color (SOC)-related literature in
      Pediatric Dermatology. To do so, we applied criteria developed by Wilson et al
      (Assessment of skin of color and diversity and inclusion content of dermatologic 
      published literature: an analysis and call to action. Int J Women Dermatol.
      2021;15:26) to categorize SOC articles. We found that Pediatric Dermatology
      published 28.4% SOC articles in the last three years, higher than the average
      (16.8%) found across surveyed dermatology journals. Our findings demonstrate
      opportunity for improvement through the implementation of keyword standardization
      and continued prioritization of SOC-related content.

TI  - Disseminated Kaposi sarcoma following COVID-19 in a 61-year-old Albanian
      immunocompetent man: a case report and review of the literature.
PG  - 152
LID - 10.1186/s40001-021-00620-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 and its related anti-inflammatory treatment (steroids,
      immunomodulators) may induce the reactivation of latent bacterial, parasitic, and
      viral infections. According to our knowledge, no case of disseminated
      HHV-8-related Kaposi sarcoma (KS) after COVID-19 and its treatment has been
      described so far. Only one case of cutaneous KS concurrently with COVID-19 has
      been previously reported. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a case of disseminated
      KS in a 61-year-old immunocompetent Albanian man after hospitalization for
      COVID-19. METHODS FOR LITERATURE RESEARCH: We used PubMed as biomedical database 
      for the literature research. We selected keyword combinations including "Kaposi
      sarcoma," "HHV-8," "immunocompetent," "COVID-19," "SARS-CoV-2," and "steroids."
      No time or language limitation was set. Titles and abstracts of selected articles
      were systematically screened. Articles were included in the examination if they
      were published under free access through the digital library of the University of
      Brescia (Italy), and provided full text. Articles were excluded if the topic was 
      beyond the aim of our study. Finally, we selected 15 articles. RESULTS: We
      describe a case of KS in COVID-19 patient and postulate that Interleukin-6 (IL-6)
      activity and steroid-induced immunodeficiency may play a major role in KS
      emergence. No published case of disseminated KS following COVID-19 in otherwise
      healthy individuals was found through the systematic literature review, despite
      the high incidence of COVID-19 in areas with medium-high prevalence of HHV-8
      infection. This observation might be explained by the role of individual genetic 
      susceptibility factors. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection and its treatment may
      lead to reactivation of several latent infections, including HHV-8 and its
      related clinical syndrome, Kaposi sarcoma.

      clinical decision support systems.
PG  - ooab106
LID - 10.1093/jamiaopen/ooab106 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Clinical Knowledge Authoring Tools (CKATs) are integral to the
      computerized Clinical Decision Support (CDS) development life cycle. CKATs enable
      authors to generate accurate, complete, and reliable digital knowledge artifacts 
      in a relatively efficient and affordable manner. This scoping review aims to
      compare knowledge authoring tools and derive the common features of CKATs.
      Materials and Methods: We performed a keyword-based literature search, followed
      by a snowball search, to identify peer-reviewed publications describing the
      development or use of CKATs. We used PubMed and Embase search engines to perform 
      the initial search (n = 1579). After removing duplicate articles, nonrelevant
      manuscripts, and not peer-reviewed publication, we identified 47 eligible studies
      describing 33 unique CKATs. The reviewed CKATs were further assessed, and salient
      characteristics were extracted and grouped as common CKAT features. Results:
      Among the identified CKATs, 55% use an open source platform, 70% provide an
      application programming interface for CDS system integration, and 79% provide
      features to validate/test the knowledge. The majority of the reviewed CKATs
      describe the flow of information, offer a graphical user interface for knowledge 
      authors, and provide intellisense coding features (94%, 97%, and 97%,
      respectively). The composed list of criteria for CKAT included topics such as
      simulating the clinical setting, validating the knowledge, standardized clinical 
      models and vocabulary, and domain independence. None of the reviewed CKATs met
      all common criteria. Conclusion: Our scoping review highlights the key
      specifications for a CKAT. The CKAT specification proposed in this review can
      guide CDS authors in developing more targeted CKATs.

PG  - 32-49
LID - 10.1016/j.jpra.2021.10.009 [doi]
AB  - Background: Post-mastectomy pain syndrome (PMPS) is a surgical complication of
      breast surgery characterized by chronic neuropathic pain. The development of PMPS
      is multifactorial and research on its prevention is limited. The objective of
      this systematic review is to synthesize the existing evidence on interventions
      for lowering the incidence of persistent neuropathic pain after breast surgery.
      Methods: Using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
      (PRISMA) guidelines, we performed a comprehensive search of the electronic
      databases of MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science,
      and ClinicalTrials.gov using a combination of database-specific controlled
      vocabulary and keyword searches. Two reviewers independently screened all unique 
      records. Publications on chronic (>3-month duration) pain after breast
      cancer-related surgery were included. Studies were classified by modality.
      Results: Our literature search yielded 7092 articles after deduplication. We
      identified 45 studies that met final inclusion criteria for analysis, including
      37 randomized-controlled trials. These studies revealed seven major intervention 
      modalities for prevention of PMPS: physical therapy, mindfulness-based cognitive 
      therapy, oral medications, surgical intervention, anesthesia, nerve blocks, and
      topical medication therapy. Conclusion: High-quality data on preventative
      techniques for PMPS are required to inform decisions for breast cancer survivors.
      We present a comprehensive assessment of the modalities available that can help
      guide breast and reconstructive surgeons employ effective strategies to lower the
      incidence and severity of PMPS. Our review supports the use of multimodal care
      involving both a peripherally targeted treatment and centrally acting medication 
      to prevent the development of PMPS.

TI  - Association Between Acute Otitis Media and Inner Ear Disorders Among Adults in
      Aseer Region.
PG  - e19556
LID - 10.7759/cureus.19556 [doi]
AB  - Introduction Acute otitis media (AOM) is an infection of the middle ear that
      produces pain, fever, and discharge, as well as hearing loss. It is one of the
      most common problems that pediatricians encounter. Almost 80% of children have
      had at least one episode of AOM, and between 80% and 90% have had at least one
      episode of otitis media with effusion before entering school. Methods The
      cross-sectional study is conducted among male and female patients, adults, and
      children who visited two of the largest government hospitals in the Aseer region 
      in Southern Saudi Arabia (Aseer Central Hospital and Khamis Mushait General
      Hospital). The children and adults with AOM who visited the hospitals were traced
      by searching the medical record system by the keyword "acute otitis media." Two
      authors extracted data from the medical record and patients. After extracting
      data, the patient will be called through mobile phone to invite them to
      participate in the study. If the patient agrees to participate, she/he would be
      sent through email link containing an encrypted and high-security electronic
      signature to obtain his/her consent. Conclusion One of the most common pediatric 
      infections is otitis media (inflammation of the middle ear). Children are more
      often than adults to get otitis media, and the majority of cases are treated with
      antibiotics. Clinicians commonly miss the acute stage of the disease, especially 
      in children under the age of five. Delay or omission of diagnoses leads to
      inefficient management and an increased risk of negative effects.

AB  - Benincasa hispida (Thunb.) Cogn. (Cucurbitaceae) is an annual climbing plant,
      native to Asia with multiple therapeutic uses in traditional medicine. This
      updated review is aimed at discussing the ethnopharmacological, phytochemical,
      pharmacological properties, and molecular mechanisms highlighted in preclinical
      experimental studies and toxicological safety to evaluate the therapeutic
      potential of this genus. The literature from PubMed, Google Scholar, Elsevier,
      Springer, Science Direct, and database was analyzed using the basic keyword
      "Benincasa hispida." Other searching strategies, including online resources,
      books, and journals, were used. The taxonomy of the plant has been made by
      consulting "The Plant List". The results showed that B. hispida has been used in 
      traditional medicine to treat neurological diseases, kidney disease, fever, and
      cough accompanied by thick mucus and to fight intestinal worms. The main
      bioactive compounds contained in Benincasa hispida have cytotoxic,
      anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. Further safety and efficacy
      investigations are needed to confirm these beneficial therapeutic effects and
      also future human clinical studies.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the impact of data-driven didactic
      sessions on metrics including fund of knowledge, resident confidence in clinical 
      topics, and stress in addition to American Board of Anesthesiology In-Training
      Examination (ITE) percentiles. DESIGN: Observational mixed-methods study.
      SETTING: Classroom, video-recorded e-learning. SUBJECTS: Anesthesiology residents
      from two academic medical centers. INTERVENTIONS: Residents were offered a
      data-driven didactic session, focused on lifelong learning regarding frequently
      asked/missed topics based on publicly-available data. MEASUREMENTS: Residents
      were surveyed regarding their confidence on exam topics, organization of study
      plan, willingness to educate others, and stress levels. Residents at one
      institution were interviewed post-ITE. The level and trend in ITE percentiles
      were compared before and after the start of this initiative using segmented
      regression analysis. RESULTS: Ninety-four residents participated in the survey. A
      comparison of pre-post responses showed an increased mean level of confidence
      (4.5 +/- 1.6 vs. 6.2 +/- 1.4; difference in means 95% CI:1.7[1.5,1.9]), sense of 
      study organization (3.8 +/- 1.6 vs. 6.7 +/- 1.3;95% CI:2.8[2.5,3.1]), willingness
      to educate colleagues (4.0 +/- 1.7 vs. 5.7 +/- 1.9;95% CI:1.7[1.4,2.0]), and
      reduced stress levels (5.9 +/- 1.9 vs. 5.2 +/- 1.7;95% CI:-0.7[-1.0,-0.4]) (all p
      < 0.001). Thirty-one residents from one institution participated in the
      interviews. Interviews exhibited qualitative themes associated with increased
      fund of knowledge, accessibility of high-yield resources, and domains from the
      Kirkpatrick Classification of an educational intervention. In an assessment of
      292 residents from 2012 to 2020 at one institution, there was a positive change
      in mean ITE percentile (adjusted intercept shift [95% CI] 11.0[3.6,18.5];p =
      0.004) and trajectory over time after the introduction of data-driven didactics. 
      CONCLUSION: Data-driven didactics was associated with improved resident
      confidence, stress, and factors related to wellness. It was also associated with 
      a change from a negative to positive trend in ITE percentiles over time. Future
      assessment of data-driven didactics and impact on resident outcomes are needed.

TI  - Leveraging medical context to recommend semantically similar terms for chart
      reviews.
PG  - 353
LID - 10.1186/s12911-021-01724-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Information retrieval (IR) help clinicians answer questions posed to 
      large collections of electronic medical records (EMRs), such as how best to
      identify a patient's cancer stage. One of the more promising approaches to IR for
      EMRs is to expand a keyword query with similar terms (e.g., augmenting cancer
      with mets). However, there is a large range of clinical chart review tasks, such 
      that fixed sets of similar terms is insufficient. Current language models, such
      as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) embeddings, do 
      not capture the full non-textual context of a task. In this study, we present new
      methods that provide similar terms dynamically by adjusting with the context of
      the chart review task. METHODS: We introduce a vector space for medical-context
      in which each word is represented by a vector that captures the word's usage in
      different medical contexts (e.g., how frequently cancer is used when ordering a
      prescription versus describing family history) beyond the context learned from
      the surrounding text. These vectors are transformed into a vector space for
      customizing the set of similar terms selected for different chart review tasks.
      We evaluate the vector space model with multiple chart review tasks, in which
      supervised machine learning models learn to predict the preferred terms of
      clinically knowledgeable reviewers. To quantify the usefulness of the predicted
      similar terms to a baseline of standard word2vec embeddings, we measure (1) the
      prediction performance of the medical-context vector space model using the area
      under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and (2) the labeling
      effort required to train the models. RESULTS: The vector space outperformed the
      baseline word2vec embeddings in all three chart review tasks with an average
      AUROC of 0.80 versus 0.66, respectively. Additionally, the medical-context vector
      space significantly reduced the number of labels required to learn and predict
      the preferred similar terms of reviewers. Specifically, the labeling effort was
      reduced to 10% of the entire dataset in all three tasks. CONCLUSIONS: The set of 
      preferred similar terms that are relevant to a chart review task can be learned
      by leveraging the medical context of the task.

      scientometric study. METHODS: Publications related to CM in the management of
      pediatric asthma were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection using
      relevant keywords. A scientometric study was performed using CiteSpace and
      VOSviewer. RESULTS: A total of 1,673 original articles and reviews from 1991 to
      2019 were included in the analysis. The amount of annual publications had a
      gradual increase with time. USA was the major contributor both in country and
      institution analyses. Based on the co-citation, the published journals were
      grouped into 4 clusters. Keyword analysis indicated that the main hotspots were: 
      (1) comprehensive management; (2) risk factors, mechanism, and prevalence; (3)
      prevention and treatment; (4) inflammation; and (5) environmental research.
      Lastly, we predicted that three emerging trends were quality of life promotion,
      immune response, and combination therapy. CONCLUSIONS: CM research in the
      management of pediatric asthma will maintain the current trend of steady growth. 
      This scientometric analysis may help scientists to identify the areas of
      interests and future directions in the field.

TI  - Can crowdsourced data help to optimize atopic dermatitis treatment? Comparing web
      search data and environmental data in Germany.
LID - 10.1111/jdv.17875 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is one of the most common chronic skin
      diseases worldwide, showing various manifestations and having a severe impact on 
      quality of life. As previous studies demonstrated, internet search analysis can
      help identify public interest in diseases and possible influencing factors on
      search behavior. OBJECTIVE: To identify AD-related topics of interest in Germany 
      using internet search volume. METHODS: Google Ads Keyword Planner was used to
      identify AD-related search terms including their search volume in Germany on a
      national level as well as in 16 selected cities from January 2016 to December
      2019. Identified keywords were qualitatively analyzed, and temporal trends as
      well as the influence of seasonal and environmental factors on search volume were
      assessed. RESULTS: Overall, 1222 AD-related search terms with a search volume of 
      8 842 360 searches were identified. An increase from 2016 to 2019 and seasonal
      peaks from January to April of each year were observed. Nationwide, the search
      volume correlated with mean monthly temperature and sun duration. With increasing
      temperature and sun duration, a significant decrease in search queries was
      observed. The most populated cities showed the lowest number of searches per 100 
      000 inhabitants (Berlin, Hamburg, and Munich). In the eight categories formed
      (comorbidities, general, influential factors, localization, stage of life,
      symptoms/severity, therapy/information, and questions on AD), the highest
      proportion of search queries were assigned to the category "therapy/information" 
      in most cities. In this category, a focus on the topics of "alternative medicine"
      and "home remedies" could be observed. CONCLUSION: The overall high and
      increasing search volume indicates a high interest in AD-related topics,
      especially regarding treatment and disease education. Information provided by
      internet search volume analyses can optimize AD therapy and patient-centered care
      by providing insight into patient needs and predicting potential climatic trigger
      factors.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To summarize the epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory
      characteristics of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) secondary to severe acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or vaccination.
      METHODS: We conducted a systematic review using standardized keyword search to
      identify all reports of SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination and AIHA across
      PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar through September 24, 2021.
      RESULTS: Fifty patients (mean [SD] age, 50.8 [21.6] years) diagnosed with
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and AIHA were identified. AIHA subtypes and
      number of patients were as follows: cold AIHA (n = 18), warm AIHA (n = 14),
      mixed-type AIHA (n = 3), direct antiglobulin test (DAT)-negative AIHA (n = 1),
      DAT-negative Evans syndrome (n = 1), Evans syndrome (n = 3), and subtype not
      reported (n = 10). Mean (SD) hemoglobin at AIHA diagnosis was 6.5 [2.8] g/dL (95%
      confidence interval, 5.7-7.3 g/dL). Median time from COVID-19 symptom onset to
      AIHA diagnosis was 7 days. In total, 19% (8/42) of patients with
      COVID-19-associated AIHA with reported outcomes were deceased. Four patients
      (mean [SD] age, 73.5 [16.9] years) developed AIHA following SARS-CoV-2
      vaccination: Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine (n = 2); Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine 
      (n = 1); undisclosed mRNA vaccine (n = 1). AIHA occurred after 1 dose in 3
      patients (median, 5 days). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination are 
      associated with multiple AIHA subtypes, beginning approximately 7 days after
      infectious symptoms and 5 days after vaccination.

TI  - Management of communication disability in the first 90 days after stroke: a
      scoping review.
PG  - 1-15
LID - 10.1080/09638288.2021.2012843 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: People with communication disability after stroke need
      interventions to optimise healthcare communication and rehabilitation outcomes.
      Current evidence syntheses do not adequately inform the management of
      communication disability during the first 90 days post-stroke. PURPOSE: To
      explore the scope of literature for the management of communication disability in
      the first 90 days after stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A scoping review was
      conducted using a systematic keyword search of six databases. A descriptive
      synthesis was generated using communication-related domains related to the
      biopsychosocial framework of the International Classification of Functioning,
      Disability, and Health (ICF). RESULTS: A total of 129 studies met eligibility
      criteria. Aphasia was the most frequently addressed communication disability
      after stroke (76/129 studies) with a paucity of evidence investigating other
      acquired neurogenic communication impairments. Management predominantly focused
      on communication-related: body functions and structures (62 studies) (e.g.,
      linguistic-behavioural therapies), followed by environmental factors (39 studies)
      (e.g., communication partner training/support); activities and participation (15 
      studies) (e.g., augmentative and alternative communication); and personal factors
      (13 studies) (e.g., assessment of depression after aphasia). CONCLUSION: A
      coordinated, integrated approach to developing and testing acute and subacute
      interventions for all communication disabilities across all communication-related
      domains is required.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONInterdisciplinary stroke
      clinicians need to manage communication disabilities in the first 90 days after
      stroke to optimise healthcare communication and rehabilitation outcomes.There is 
      some evidence to guide clinicians in aphasia management but less in other
      disabilities of speech and cognitive functioning.Most interventions to inform
      clinical practice address communication-related body functions and structures
      (e.g., linguistic and speech therapies). Clinicians need to address all domains
      and more evidence is needed to address environmental factors (e.g., communication
      support); activities and participation (e.g., person-centred goal setting); and
      personal factors (e.g., psychological care).

PG  - 779792
LID - 10.3389/fdata.2021.779792 [doi]
AB  - Often thought of as higher-order entities, events have recently become important 
      subjects of research in the computational sciences, including within complex
      systems and natural language processing (NLP). One such application is event link
      prediction. Given an input event, event link prediction is the problem of
      retrieving a relevant set of events, similar to the problem of retrieving
      relevant documents on the Web in response to keyword queries. Since geopolitical 
      events have complex semantics, it is an open question as to how to best model and
      represent events within the framework of event link prediction. In this paper, we
      formalize the problem and discuss how established representation learning
      algorithms from the machine learning community could potentially be applied to
      it. We then conduct a detailed empirical study on the Global Terrorism Database
      (GTD) using a set of metrics inspired by the information retrieval community. Our
      results show that, while there is considerable signal in both network-theoretic
      and text-centric models of the problem, classic text-only models such as
      bag-of-words prove surprisingly difficult to outperform. Our results establish
      both a baseline for event link prediction on GTD, and currently outstanding
      challenges for the research community to tackle in this space.

TI  - Bibliometric Analysis of Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Studies on
      Acupuncture Analgesia Over the Past 20 Years.

AB  - Background: Researches on the central mechanisms of acupuncture analgesia have
      been widely conducted worldwide. However, there is no bibliometric analysis of
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies on acupuncture analgesia.
      This study visualized the current status, hot spots and frontiers of fMRI studies
      on acupuncture analgesia in the past 20 years to provide a theoretical basis for 
      its clinical application. Methods: All publications were obtained from Science
      Citation Index-Expanded (SCI-E) of Web of Science (WOS). We used CiteSpace to
      analyze publications, journals, cited journals, authors, cited authors,
      institutions, countries, references, and keywords. We also analyzed collaborative
      network maps and co-occurrence network maps. Results: We retrieved a total of 797
      articles. Regarding the volume of publications, the total number of annual
      publications showed a fluctuating but overall increasing trend. Evidence-based
      Complementary and Alternative Medicine (21 articles) was the most productive
      journal, and Pain (225 articles) was the most cited journal. The most productive 
      author was Qin W (16 articles), and the most co-cited author was Hui KKS (111).
      The most prolific institution and country were Massachusetts General Hospital (34
      articles) and USA (212 articles). "Pain" was the top-ranked for keyword frequency
      and centrality. "Functional connectivity" was the frontier hotspot for 2018-2021.
      Conclusion: First, fMRI researches on acupuncture analgesia involved several
      countries (regions) and institutions, mainly located in the USA, China and Korea,
      and most of them were universities. In addition, the USA was a major contributor 
      in this field. Second, in terms of disciplinary distribution, the literatures
      were mainly from clinical neurology, neuroscience, and radiology nuclear medicine
      medical imaging. Third, the keyword co-occurrence analysis showed that the hot
      keywords included pain, fMRI, and lower back pain. Fourth, through keyword
      clustering analysis, the hot disease was found to be lower back pain, and the hot
      contents were acupuncture specificity and frequency specificity. Fifth, a
      timeline analysis of the references identified that chronic low back pain and
      specificity will remain a hot topic for future research.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has been a major source of stress for a majority of people 
      that might have negative long-term effects on mental health and well-being. In
      recent years, video games and their potential positive effects on stress relief
      have been researched and "relaxation" has been an important keyword in marketing 
      a certain kind of video game. In a quasi-experimental design, this study
      investigated the increase of average daily player peak (ADPPs) for the COVID
      period compared to the pre-COVID period and if this increase was significantly
      larger for relaxing games in contrast to non-relaxing games. Results showed a
      medium-sized increase of ADPPs over all types of games but no difference between 
      relaxing games and non-relaxing games. These results are discussed in regards to 
      their potential of presenting gaps between the current theoretical models of the 
      influence of video games on mental health and actual observed player behaviour.

TI  - Automated COVID-19 detection from X-ray and CT images with stacked ensemble
      convolutional neural network.
PG  - 27-41
LID - 10.1016/j.bbe.2021.12.001 [doi]
AB  - Automatic and rapid screening of COVID-19 from the radiological (X-ray or CT
      scan) images has become an urgent need in the current pandemic situation of
      SARS-CoV-2 worldwide. However, accurate and reliable screening of patients is
      challenging due to the discrepancy between the radiological images of COVID-19
      and other viral pneumonia. So, in this paper, we design a new stacked
      convolutional neural network model for the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19
      disease from the chest X-ray and CT images. In the proposed approach, different
      sub-models have been obtained from the VGG19 and the Xception models during the
      training. Thereafter, obtained sub-models are stacked together using softmax
      classifier. The proposed stacked CNN model combines the discriminating power of
      the different CNN's sub-models and detects COVID-19 from the radiological images.
      In addition, we collect CT images to build a CT image dataset and also generate
      an X-ray images dataset by combining X-ray images from the three publicly
      available data repositories. The proposed stacked CNN model achieves a
      sensitivity of 97.62% for the multi-class classification of X-ray images into
      COVID-19, Normal and Pneumonia Classes and 98.31% sensitivity for binary
      classification of CT images into COVID-19 and no-Finding classes. Our proposed
      approach shows superiority over the existing methods for the detection of the
      COVID-19 cases from the X-ray radiological images.

AB  - Background: A bibliometric analysis of the Annals of Laboratory Medicine (ALM)
      was performed to understand its position in the medical laboratory technology
      category and to suggest a developmental strategy. Methods: Journal metrics,
      including the number of articles by publication type, country of authors, total
      citations, 2-year impact factor, country of cited authors, journals citing ALM,
      and Hirsch-index, were obtained from the Journal Citation Report and Web of
      Science Core Collection. Target data included ALM content in the Web of Science
      from January 1, 2012, to October 5, 2021. Bibliometric analysis was performed
      using Biblioshiny. Results: The impact factor increased from 1.481 in 2013 to
      3.464 in 2020. Authors belonging to the USA, China, and Korea cited ALM articles 
      the most. Plos One, Scientific Reports, and Frontiers in Microbiology most
      frequently cited ALM, besides ALM itself. The Hirsch-index was 34. The
      co-occurrence network of Keyword Plus indicated four clusters: diagnosis,
      identification, prevalence, and risk. The conceptual structure map of Keyword
      Plus based on multiple correspondence analysis showed two clusters: bacterial
      susceptibility at the bench and clinical courses. The co-citation network showed 
      that ALM was in the cluster of the New England Journal of Medicine, The Lancet,
      JAMA, and the Annals of Internal Medicine. The collaboration network showed that 
      Korean authors collaborated mainly with authors from the USA, Germany, and Italy.
      Conclusions: The journal's promotion to an international top-tier journal has
      been successful. "Principles of transparency and best practice in scholarly
      publishing" and a preprint policy are yet to be added.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia is proposed as a disorder of dysconnectivity. However, 
      examination of complexities of dysconnectivity has been challenging. Structural
      covariance networks (SCN) provide important insights into the nature of
      dysconnectivity. This systematic review examines the SCN studies that employed
      statistical approaches to elucidate covariation of regional morphometric
      variations. METHODS: A systematic search of literature was conducted for
      peer-reviewed publications using different keywords and keyword combinations for 
      schizophrenia. Fifty-two studies met the criteria. RESULTS: Early SCN studies
      began using correlational structure of selected regions. Over the last 3 decades,
      methodological approaches have grown increasingly sophisticated from examining
      selected brain regions using correlation tests on small sample sizes to recent
      approaches that use advanced statistical methods to examine covariance structure 
      of whole-brain parcellations on larger samples. Although the results are not
      fully consistent across all studies, a pattern of fronto-temporal,
      fronto-parietal and fronto-thalamic covariation is reported. Attempts to
      associate SCN alterations with functional connectivity, to differentiate between 
      disease-related and neurodevelopment-related morphometric changes, and to develop
      "causality-based" models are being reported. Clinical correlation with outcome,
      psychotic symptoms, neurocognitive and social cognitive performance are also
      reported. CONCLUSIONS: Application of advanced statistical methods are beginning 
      to provide insights into interesting patterns of regional covariance including
      correlations with clinical and cognitive data. Although these findings appear
      similar to morphometric studies, SCNs have the advantage of highlighting topology
      of these regions and their relationship to the disease and associated variables. 
      Further studies are needed to investigate neurobiological underpinnings of shared
      covariance, and causal links to clinical domains.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Examination of structural covariance network (SCN) is gaining
      prominence among the strategies to delineate dysconnectivity that case-control
      morphometric comparisons cannot address. Part II of this review extends on the
      part I of the review that included SCN studies using statistical approaches by
      examining SCN studies applying graph theoretic approaches to elucidate network
      properties in schizophrenia. This review also includes SCN studies using graph
      theoretic or statistical approaches on persons at-risk for schizophrenia.
      METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted for peer-reviewed
      publications using different keywords and keyword combinations for schizophrenia 
      and risk for schizophrenia. Thirteen studies on schizophrenia and five on persons
      at risk for schizophrenia met the criteria. RESULTS: A variety of findings from
      over the last 1(1/2) decades showing qualitative and quantitative differences in 
      the global and local structural connectome in schizophrenia are described. These 
      observations include altered hub patterns, disrupted network topology and
      hierarchical organization of the brain, and impaired connections that may be
      localized to default mode, executive control, and dorsal attention networks. Some
      of these connectomic alterations were observed in persons at-risk for
      schizophrenia before the onset of the illness. CONCLUSIONS: Observed disruptions 
      may reduce network efficiency and capacity to integrate information. Further,
      global connectomic changes were not schizophrenia-specific but local network
      changes were. Existing studies have used different atlases for brain
      parcellation, examined different morphometric features, and patients at different
      stages of illness making it difficult to conduct meta-analysis. Future studies
      should harmonize such methodological differences to facilitate meta-analysis and 
      also elucidate causal underpinnings of dysconnectivity.

AB  - COVID-19 is a pandemic disease affecting billions of people worldwide. Taking
      vaccines is a most effective approach to gain fully control. Thanks to the
      coordinated efforts from all over the world, several brands of vaccines targeting
      COVID-19 have passed through clinical trials and been brought to the public.
      Growing numbers of people are taking vaccines and share their feedback on social 
      media, mostly on Twitter. In this study, we used Twitter data to analyze the side
      effects on each individual and quantify these side effects in a brand-wise and
      country-wise manner. Based on Twitter data, we found that the United States has
      the largest number of people getting vaccinated, Pfizer is the most widely used
      vaccine brand around the world and the most frequent side effect is cold. From
      our analysis, the side effects of vaccines are under controllable and are
      acceptable, and everyone can join the vaccinated camping without hesitation.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence Education Programs for Health Care Professionals: Scoping
      Review.
PG  - e31043
LID - 10.2196/31043 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: As the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in health care
      increases, it will become increasingly crucial to involve health care
      professionals (HCPs) in developing, validating, and implementing AI-enabled
      technologies. However, because of a lack of AI literacy, most HCPs are not
      adequately prepared for this revolution. This is a significant barrier to
      adopting and implementing AI that will affect patients. In addition, the limited 
      existing AI education programs face barriers to development and implementation at
      various levels of medical education. OBJECTIVE: With a view to informing future
      AI education programs for HCPs, this scoping review aims to provide an overview
      of the types of current or past AI education programs that pertains to the
      programs' curricular content, modes of delivery, critical implementation factors 
      for education delivery, and outcomes used to assess the programs' effectiveness. 
      METHODS: After the creation of a search strategy and keyword searches, a 2-stage 
      screening process was conducted by 2 independent reviewers to determine study
      eligibility. When consensus was not reached, the conflict was resolved by
      consulting a third reviewer. This process consisted of a title and abstract scan 
      and a full-text review. The articles were included if they discussed an actual
      training program or educational intervention, or a potential training program or 
      educational intervention and the desired content to be covered, focused on AI,
      and were designed or intended for HCPs (at any stage of their career). RESULTS:
      Of the 10,094 unique citations scanned, 41 (0.41%) studies relevant to our
      eligibility criteria were identified. Among the 41 included studies, 10 (24%)
      described 13 unique programs and 31 (76%) discussed recommended curricular
      content. The curricular content of the unique programs ranged from AI use, AI
      interpretation, and cultivating skills to explain results derived from AI
      algorithms. The curricular topics were categorized into three main domains:
      cognitive, psychomotor, and affective. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides an
      overview of the current landscape of AI in medical education and highlights the
      skills and competencies required by HCPs to effectively use AI in enhancing the
      quality of care and optimizing patient outcomes. Future education efforts should 
      focus on the development of regulatory strategies, a multidisciplinary approach
      to curriculum redesign, a competency-based curriculum, and patient-clinician
      interaction.

      notes.
PG  - 472-480
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocab261 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Accurate identification of self-harm presentations to Emergency
      Departments (ED) can lead to more timely mental health support, aid in
      understanding the burden of suicidal intent in a population, and support impact
      evaluation of public health initiatives related to suicide prevention. Given lack
      of manual self-harm reporting in ED, we aim to develop an automated system for
      the detection of self-harm presentations directly from ED triage notes. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: We frame this as supervised classification using natural language
      processing (NLP), utilizing a large data set of 477 627 free-text triage notes
      from ED presentations in 2012-2018 to The Royal Melbourne Hospital, Australia.
      The data were highly imbalanced, with only 1.4% of triage notes relating to
      self-harm. We explored various preprocessing techniques, including spelling
      correction, negation detection, bigram replacement, and clinical concept
      recognition, and several machine learning methods. RESULTS: Our results show that
      machine learning methods dramatically outperform keyword-based methods. We
      achieved the best results with a calibrated Gradient Boosting model, showing 90% 
      Precision and 90% Recall (PR-AUC 0.87) on blind test data. Prospective validation
      of the model achieves similar results (88% Precision; 89% Recall). DISCUSSION: ED
      notes are noisy texts, and simple token-based models work best. Negation
      detection and concept recognition did not change the results while bigram
      replacement significantly impaired model performance. CONCLUSION: This first
      NLP-based classifier for self-harm in ED notes has practical value for
      identifying patients who would benefit from mental health follow-up in ED, and
      for supporting surveillance of self-harm and suicide prevention efforts in the
      population.

AB  - OBJECT: Epilepsy is one of the most common clinical manifestations of primary
      brain tumors. Intraoperative electrocorticography (ECoG) has been widely used in 
      tumor resection. We aim to describe the indication and utility of ECoG during
      brain tumor surgery. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the literature 
      on the prognosis of tumor-related epilepsy surgery guided by intraoperative ECoG.
      The published studies were searched in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science using
      the keyword 'seizure' or 'epilepsy' and 'electrocorticography' or 'ECoG'. Two
      reviewer authors screened studies and extracted data independently. RESULTS:
      Thirteen studies included 569 patients were finally selected, of which eight
      investigated medically intractable epilepsy. Three publications described
      temporal tumor-related epilepsy. All included studies were retrospective, and the
      age of all patients ranged from 1 to 71 years. The duration of epilepsy ranged
      from 1 month to 30 years. Patients with tumor-related epilepsy underwent surgical
      treatment with Engel I outcomes ranging from 56.5%-100%. CONCLUSION:
      Intraoperative ECoG is generally considered a useful technique in delineating
      epileptogenic areas and improving the prognosis of surgical treatment of
      tumor-related epilepsy. However, large-scale randomized control trials are still 
      needed to verify these findings and formulate appropriate surgical strategies.

TI  - Advancing the conversation: A review of scholarly activity for curricular
      interventions for sexually- and gender-diverse patients in pharmacy education.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Educational interventions are required to train pharmacists to
      provide culturally safe care to sexually- and gender-diverse patients.
      Programming must promote inclusivity and should also focus on systemwide change. 
      The aim of this review was to identify, summarize, and map scholarly activity
      with respect to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, plus (LGBTQ+) health 
      in entry-to-practice pharmacy curricula. METHODS: An electronic search of
      Medline, EMBASE, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts was conducted to
      search for relevant literature up to May 2021. This search was supplemented with 
      a keyword search of three pharmacy education journals. Articles were included in 
      the review if they described an educational intervention for entry-to-practice
      pharmacy students related to health for sexually- or gender-diverse patients.
      RESULTS: Five articles met inclusion criteria. All articles reported
      interventions relating to gender-diverse patients. One reported interventions
      relating to sexually-diverse patients and another was deemed unclear. Four
      articles reported single teaching events or short modules, and one article
      reported a full course. Incorporating real patients into teaching events to share
      their experiences with the health system was consistently received positively by 
      students. IMPLICATIONS: Scholars involved in developing and implementing
      educational interventions related to health for sexually- and gender-diverse
      patients should be encouraged to contribute to the scholarly conversation by
      sharing successful experiences, as well as lessons learned. Future areas of
      expansion include integration of sexual and gender minority health across
      curricula and including content to prepare students for implementing and
      supporting systemwide change.

TI  - Preliminary Analysis of the Risk Factor Identification Embedding Model for
      Cardiovascular Disease.
PG  - 1946-1949
LID - 10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9630039 [doi]
AB  - Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is responsible for a large part of healthcare costs 
      every year, but susceptibility to it is affected by complex biological and
      physiological variables including patients' genetics and lifestyles. There has
      not been much work to develop a framework that incorporates these important and
      clinically relevant risk factors into a comprehensive model for CVD research.
      Moreover, the data labeling required to do so, such as annotating gene functions,
      is an extremely challenging, tedious, and time-consuming process. In this work,
      our goal was to develop and validate a risk factor embedding model, which
      incorporates genotype, phenotype without pre-labeled information to identify
      various risk factors of CVD. We hypothesize that (1) the knowledge background
      that does not require data labeling could be gathered from published abstract
      data, (2) the phenotype, genotype risk factors could be represented in an
      embedding vector space. We collected 1,363,682 published abstracts from PubMed
      using the keyword "heart" and 19,264 human gene names, then trained our model
      using the collected abstracts. We evaluated our CVD risk factor identification
      model using both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations: for the intrinsic
      evaluation, we examined whether or not the captured top-10 words and genes have
      references related to the input query "myocardial infarction", as one of CVDs,
      and our model correctly identified them. For the extrinsic evaluation, we used
      our model to the dimensionality reduction task for classifications, and our
      method outperformed other popular methods. These results show the feasibility of 
      our approach for disease-associated risk factors of CVD which incorporates
      genotype, phenotype.Clinical Relevance-Our model provides a comprehensive tool to
      incorporate various risk factors without any a priori data labeling knowledge for
      CVD. Our approach shows a potential to provide discovered knowledge that
      contributes to better understanding and treatment of CVD.

TI  - Transparency of deep neural networks for medical image analysis: A review of
      interpretability methods.
PG  - 105111
LID - S0010-4825(21)00905-7 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.105111 [doi]
AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a useful aid in numerous clinical
      applications for diagnosis and treatment decisions. Deep neural networks have
      shown the same or better performance than clinicians in many tasks owing to the
      rapid increase in the available data and computational power. In order to conform
      to the principles of trustworthy AI, it is essential that the AI system be
      transparent, robust, fair, and ensure accountability. Current deep neural
      solutions are referred to as black-boxes due to a lack of understanding of the
      specifics concerning the decision-making process. Therefore, there is a need to
      ensure the interpretability of deep neural networks before they can be
      incorporated into the routine clinical workflow. In this narrative review, we
      utilized systematic keyword searches and domain expertise to identify nine
      different types of interpretability methods that have been used for understanding
      deep learning models for medical image analysis applications based on the type of
      generated explanations and technical similarities. Furthermore, we report the
      progress made towards evaluating the explanations produced by various
      interpretability methods. Finally, we discuss limitations, provide guidelines for
      using interpretability methods and future directions concerning the
      interpretability of deep neural networks for medical imaging analysis.

TI  - Anti-cancer Research on Arnebiae Radix-derived Naphthoquinone in Recent Five
      Years.
LID - 10.2174/1574892816666211209164745 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, many naphthoquinone compounds with anticancer
      activity have been identified in Arnebiae Radix, and some of them have the
      potential to be developed into anticancer drugs. OBJECTIVE: This article aimed to
      provide a comprehensive overview of the anticancer effects of naphthoquinone
      compounds through a detailed review of literature and Chinese patents, and
      discuss their potential to be developed as anticancer drugs for clinical
      application. METHODS: Research papers were collected through the databases of
      PubMed, Cnki and SciDirect using keyword searches "naphthoquinone compounds" and 
      "anticancer". The keywords of "shikonin" and "shikonin derivatives" were also
      used in PubMed, Cnki and SciDirect databases to collect research articles. The
      Chinese patents were collected using the Cnki patent database. RESULTS:
      Naphthoquinone compounds have been found to possess anti-cancer activity, and
      their modes of action are associated with inducing apoptosis, inhibiting cancer
      cell proliferation, promoting autophagy in cancer cells, anti-cancer angiogenesis
      and inhibition of cell adhesion, invasion and metastasis, inhibiting glycolysis
      and inhibiting DNA topoisomerase activity. CONCLUSION: Most of the naphthoquinone
      compounds show effective anti-cancer activity in vitro. The structure
      modification of naphthoquinone aims to develop anti-cancer drugs with high
      efficacy and low toxicity.

LID - 10.3390/ijerph182312446 [doi]
AB  - Diathermy techniques embody an oscillating electrical current passaging through
      the body tissues generating therapeutic heat; use of this technique in the
      physiotherapy field has been introduced recently, and because there is scarce
      information, the following review is proposed, aiming to explore the available
      evidence on applying CRET in physiotherapy clinical practice and sports. A
      systematic search was led through a keyword search on PubMed, MedLine, DialNet,
      Scopus, PEDro, Web of Science and Clinicaltrials databases. Including randomised 
      controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies, which applied radiofrequency
      diathermy in sports and physiotherapy fields, without any restrictions on dates, 
      published in Spanish, English, Portuguese or Italian. Data extraction was
      conducted through the Cochrane data extraction form and presented in tabular
      format; 30 articles were included for analysis, and assessment of methodological 
      quality was made through the PEDro scale with a "Good/Fair" general quality
      score. The nature of existing articles does not allow a quantitative analysis.
      Conclusion: identified fields of applications were musculoskeletal physiotherapy,
      treatment of pelvic floor and sexual dysfunctions, as well as dermato-functional 
      physiotherapy and sports, evidencing an increase of skin temperature, enhanced
      skin and muscle blood perfusion, as well as reporting an increase in
      oxyhaemoglobin. Further research is needed. Prospero registration number:

TI  - Linguistic Patterns for Code Word Resilient Hate Speech Identification.
LID - 7859 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s21237859 [doi]
AB  - The permanent transition to online activity has brought with it a surge in hate
      speech discourse. This has prompted increased calls for automatic detection
      methods, most of which currently rely on a dictionary of hate speech words, and
      supervised classification. This approach often falls short when dealing with
      newer words and phrases produced by online extremist communities. These code
      words are used with the aim of evading automatic detection by systems. Code words
      are frequently used and have benign meanings in regular discourse, for instance, 
      "skypes, googles, bing, yahoos" are all examples of words that have a hidden hate
      speech meaning. Such overlap presents a challenge to the traditional keyword
      approach of collecting data that is specific to hate speech. In this work, we
      first introduced a word embedding model that learns the hidden hate speech
      meaning of words. With this insight on code words, we developed a classifier that
      leverages linguistic patterns to reduce the impact of individual words. The
      proposed method was evaluated across three different datasets to test its
      generalizability. The empirical results show that the linguistic patterns
      approach outperforms the baselines and enables further analysis on hate speech
      expressions.

AB  - During a Disaster Victims Identification (DVI) mission, international protocols
      rely on interdisciplinary work, especially between specialists from forensic
      imaging and anthropology. In case of air crashes or explosions, DVI units may
      face thousands of fragmented human remains (FHRs). The physical re-association of
      FHRs and the identification process is very complex and challenging, and relies
      upon expensive and destructive DNA analysis. A virtual re-association (VRA) of
      these fragments, using Multidetector Computed Tomography (MDCT), could be a
      helpful tool in forensic anthropology analysis, as it could assist in reducing
      the number of DNA samples. However, there is no standardized protocol for
      including such an approach into a DVI procedure. The aim of this study was to
      summarize and analyze existing techniques through a systematic review and to
      develop a protocol for virtual re-association of FHRs, adapted to the DVI
      context. A keyword-based literature search was conducted, focusing on the VRA
      methods using MDCT imaging and 3D surface scan methodology. Reviews and primary
      articles, published between 2005 and 2020 in the fields of forensic anthropology,
      paleoanthropology, archeology, and fracture reduction surgery were sorted out. A 
      total of 45 publications were selected and analyzed based on their content and
      relevance. The results show that research on the re-association of FHRs increased
      significantly during the last five years. Seven steps regarding the MDCT-based
      method for the virtual re-association of FHRs could be identified: acquisition of
      3D-images, segmentation of the MDCT-data, post-processing and surface generation,
      identification of intact and fracture surfaces, identification and registration
      of matching fragments, and validation of the re-association. The literature is
      surprisingly sparse regarding the FHRs re-association as a forensic tool, and
      mainly consists in case reports, whereas validated methods were presented in
      archeology and surgery publications. However, we were able to adapt the
      MDCT-based approach for the virtual re-association of the FHRs and propose an
      innovative protocol for DVI missions. This protocol includes the needed details, 
      from the acquisition of MDCT imaging to the virtual re-association of 3D models
      and its validation. Each step has to be fully tested, adapted and validated in
      future studies.

AB  - Background: Limited attention has been paid to the natural history, management,
      and treatment outcomes related to the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL)-deficient
      knee joint. Purpose: To perform a comprehensive bibliometric analysis to evaluate
      the 50 top-cited articles in PCL research. Study Design: Cross-sectional study.
      Methods: We performed a keyword-based search in the Thomson Reuters Web of
      Science to generate a list of the 50 most cited articles relevant to the PCL. The
      included articles were analyzed according to journal, country of origin,
      publication year, total number of citations, citations per year, citation trends,
      and type of study (clinical vs basic science). Results: The 50 top-cited articles
      were published between 1975 and 2012, and the number of individual article
      citations ranged between 98 and 410. The listed articles were published in 7
      journals, with the American Journal of Sports Medicine contributing to more than 
      half of the articles and citations. The United States contributed the most
      articles (84%) and citations (n = 4873). There were 32 clinical studies and 18
      basic science studies. All clinical studies had level 4 clinical evidence, and
      topics included the natural history of PCL tears, factors predicting the need for
      surgical intervention, and long-term outcomes of isolated PCL injuries and
      combined capsuloligamentous injuries. Most (77.8%) of the top-cited basic science
      articles consisted of experimental or biomechanical studies on human cadaveric
      knees. Conclusion: The current analysis suggests that PCL research is still
      evolving and needs high-quality prospective evidence to establish sound
      recommendations.

      Processing: A Review.
PG  - 43
LID - 10.4103/jpi.jpi_103_20 [doi]
AB  - Digital pathology is gaining prominence among the researchers with developments
      in advanced imaging modalities and new technologies. Generative adversarial
      networks (GANs) are a recent development in the field of artificial intelligence 
      and since their inception, have boosted considerable interest in digital
      pathology. GANs and their extensions have opened several ways to tackle many
      challenging histopathological image processing problems such as color
      normalization, virtual staining, ink removal, image enhancement, automatic
      feature extraction, segmentation of nuclei, domain adaptation and data
      augmentation. This paper reviews recent advances in histopathological image
      processing using GANs with special emphasis on the future perspectives related to
      the use of such a technique. The papers included in this review were retrieved by
      conducting a keyword search on Google Scholar and manually selecting the papers
      on the subject of H&E stained digital pathology images for histopathological
      image processing. In the first part, we describe recent literature that use GANs 
      in various image preprocessing tasks such as stain normalization, virtual
      staining, image enhancement, ink removal, and data augmentation. In the second
      part, we describe literature that use GANs for image analysis, such as nuclei
      detection, segmentation, and feature extraction. This review illustrates the role
      of GANs in digital pathology with the objective to trigger new research on the
      application of generative models in future research in digital pathology
      informatics.

TI  - SocialSift: Target Query Discovery on Online Social Media With Deep Reinforcement
      Learning.
LID - 10.1109/TNNLS.2021.3130587 [doi]
AB  - Among the prohibitively large volume of posts (e.g., tweets in Twitter) on online
      social networks (OSNs), how to design effective queries to explore the ones of
      interest is a pressing problem. There are two main challenges to address the
      problem. First, given public application programming interfaces (APIs) for
      querying posts related to keywords from an extremely large vocabulary, how to
      infer the keywords relevant to our target interest using as few queries as
      possible? Second, how to deal with the agnostics of OSN's API? i.e., as different
      social networks typically have different running mechanisms, even with some
      randomness in returning results, how to build the knowledge of the API returns
      w.r.t. target interests from scratches? To address the above two challenges, we
      propose a target query discovery framework based on a deep reinforcement learning
      approach, named SocialSift. SocialSift intelligently interacts with OSNs'
      keyword-based API and develops its own knowledge in searching the optimal queries
      w.r.t. the target interests as well as OSN APIs. Specifically, to address the
      first challenge, we are inspired by the human searching experience, and recognize
      learning to query with context awareness to reduce the searching space, by
      qualifying keywords from returned results and keeping the tracks of the query
      trial history, or say contexts. As for addressing the second challenge, we treat 
      OSNs' APIs as black boxes and probabilistically quantify query-interest pairs
      guided by rewards, which is a well-curated indicator w.r.t. target interests.
      Empirical results on three popular OSNs: Twitter, Reddit, and Amazon demonstrate 
      our SocialSift significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines by 12% in
      retrieving target posts.

TI  - Finding and understanding pedal misapplication crashes using a deep learning
      natural language model.
PG  - S169-S172
LID - 10.1080/15389588.2021.1982616 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop a system which used the
      BERT natural language understanding model to identify pedal misapplication (PM)
      crashes from their crash narratives and validate the accuracy of the system.
      METHODS: The training dataset used for this study was 11 cases from the NMVCCS
      study and 952 cases from the North Carolina state crash database. Cases for this 
      study were selected from their respective full datasets using a keyword search
      algorithm containing terms indicative of a pedal-related mistake. A BERT language
      model was used to classify each case narrative as either no pedal misapplication,
      PM by vehicle 1, PM by vehicle 2, or PM by vehicle 3. After training, the
      language model was used to determine the incidence of pedal misapplication in a
      test dataset of 8,668 North Carolina and NMVCCS cases and these results were
      compared to a manual review of the dataset. After manual review, 2,969 cases were
      pedal misapplications. RESULTS: The model's AUC ROC performance at detecting PM
      was quantified on the entire testing dataset to evaluate the power of the system 
      to generalize to case narratives unseen at training time. The AUC ROC value was
      0.9835, indicating strong generalization to all crash narratives. By choosing the
      optimal threshold using the ROC curve, the system correctly identified PM in
      95.7% of crash narratives. When pedal misapplication was correctly identified,
      the correct vehicle was identified in 95.9% of cases. A total of 3,062 pedal
      misapplications were identified. The model labeled cases 353 times faster than a 
      researcher. CONCLUSIONS: The strong performance of the model suggests that the
      automated interpretation of case narratives can be used for future research
      studies without any manual review. This would save time and enable the use of
      datasets where manual review would be infeasible. The automated extraction of
      information from crash narratives using deep learning natural language models has
      not been demonstrated previously in the literature, to the best of the authors'
      knowledge. This technique can be applied to large, infrequently used datasets of 
      crash narratives and extended to extract useful vehicle, occupant, or environment
      information to make these datasets amenable to traditional statistical analyses.

TI  - Research on high anal fistula: a bibliometric analysis.
PG  - 11492-11503
LID - 10.21037/apm-21-3190 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: High anal fistula (HAF) treatment is more complicated than low anal
      fistula treatment. Improper treatment can easily affect anal function. The main
      treatment of HAF is surgery; however, external medicine and systemic medicine may
      also be used as adjuvant treatments. This study used bibliometric methods to
      analyze the relevant literature and provide a rough outline of the current status
      of HAF research. METHODS: A subject word-search strategy was used to retrieve
      HAF-related documents from the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-E) database. 
      CiteSpace software was used to analyze the exported raw data files, and draw a
      visual map, and BUSRT was used to detect and analyze the usage of keywords.
      RESULTS: A total of 1,020 documents were retrieved using "high anal fistula" as
      the search term, and the number of documents generally shows an increasing trend 
      over time. These papers were mainly published in developed countries, such as
      Europe and the United States (US). The US is the country that has carried out the
      most relevant cooperative research; however, there is a lack of cooperation among
      a large number of authors. The keyword analysis showed that the current research 
      focus is the treatment of HAF, while research on the prevention of HAF is largely
      lacking. CONCLUSIONS: More international multi-center clinical research studies
      on HAF should be conducted, and research on HAF prevention should also be
      strengthened.

TI  - Woman authorship in pre-print versus peer-reviewed oral health-related
      publications: A two-year observational study.
PG  - e0260791
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0260791 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Women in oral health science face similar societal issues and
      challenges as those in other STEMM careers, and gender disparities continue to
      exist as evidenced by fewer women represented as first and last authors in
      scientific publications. Pre-prints may serve as a conduit to immediately
      disseminating one's work, bypassing the arduous peer review process and its
      associated inherent biases. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to 1]
      compare the gender of first and last authors in pre-print versus peer reviewed
      publications, 2] examine the composition of first and last author pairs as
      stratified by publication type, and 3] examine the correlation between woman
      authorship and institutional geographic location and publication metrics
      stratified by publication type. METHODS: The keyword "oral health" was used to
      search for publications in BioRxiv and Pubmed in the years 2018 and 2019. Gender 
      of first and last authors were determined, and its frequency was considered as
      the primary outcome. Additionally, the geographic location of the author's
      associated institution and publication metrics measured by Altmetrics score were 
      extracted. Data was descriptively summarized by frequencies and percentages.
      Chi-square analysis was conducted for categorical variables which included the
      relationship between gender and publication type as well as gender and region of 
      author's associated institution. Binomial regression analysis was conducted to
      analyze the relationship between gender and Altmetrics. RESULTS: Woman first
      authors comprised 40.3% of pre-prints and 64.5% of peer reviewed publications
      [p<0.05]. Woman last authors comprised 31.3% of pre-prints and 61.5% of peer
      reviewed publications [p<0.05]. When analyzing the relationships between first
      and last author, the Man-Man pairing represented 47.7% of the pre-print
      publications and the Woman-Woman pairing comprised a majority of the of the peer 
      review publications at 47.5%. All results were statistically significant with a
      p-value <0.05. No significant correlation was found between region of institution
      or Altmetrics and gender of first or last authors [p>0.05]. CONCLUSION: For the
      first time in oral health science, it was found that women show higher
      representation as first and last author positions in peer reviewed publications
      versus pre-prints.

AB  - Coronaviruses (CoV) cause respiratory and intestinal infections. We conducted
      this bibliometric analysis and systematical review to explore the CoV-related
      research trends from before COVID-19. We systematically searched the Ovid
      MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and Web of Science (WOS) databases for published
      bibliometric analyses of CoV from database inception to January 24, 2021. The WOS
      Collection was searched from inception to January 31, 2020, to acquire the
      CoV-related publications before COVID-19. One-Way ANOVA and Bonferroni
      multiple-comparison tests were used to compare differences. Visualization mapping
      and keyword cluster graphs were made to illustrate the research topics and
      hotpots. We included 14,141 CoV-related publications for the bibliometric
      analysis and 16 (12 articles) CoV-related bibliometric analyses for the
      systematic review. Both the systematic review and bibliometric analysis showed
      (1) the number of publications showed two steep upward trajectories in 2003-2004 
      and in 2012-2014; (2) the research hotpots mainly focused on the mechanism,
      pathology, epidemiology, clinical diagnosis, and treatment of the coronavirus in 
      MERS-CoV and SARS-Cov; (3) the USA, and China; the University of Hong Kong; and
      Yuen KY, came from the University of Hong Kong contributed most; (4) the Journal 
      of Virology had the largest number of CoV related studies. More studies should
      focus on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in the future.

AB  - This paper conducts in-depth research and analysis on the construction of the
      public information product APP application platform of urban big media in the
      context of artificial intelligence and discusses its development. Based on the
      improvement of the SICAS model, a model of enterprise and user information
      interaction characteristics in the new media environment is constructed, and
      social network analysis and semantic analysis methods are used to research
      enterprise and user information interaction characteristics in the new media
      environment. The point degree centrality index is used to analyze forwarding and 
      being forwarded behavior in information interaction, the intermediate centrality 
      index is used to analyze following and being followed behavior, the proximity
      centrality index is used to analyze commenting and being commented behavior, the 
      feature vector centrality index is used to analyze the cohesiveness of
      information interaction behavior, and the semantic keyword word is used to
      analyze the semantic keyword word in the research process. The results of the
      study show that the constructed model can analyze the information interaction
      behaviors of enterprises and users in the new media environment. The research
      results show that the constructed model can systematically analyze the
      information interaction characteristics, and the information interaction between 
      enterprises and users in the new media environment is more timely, more
      effective, and more satisfying to users. The current situation of the
      construction of the public information platform and the problems existing in the 
      construction are proposed to achieve the standardization of the construction of
      the public information platform in the context of smart city, the construction of
      the platform supervision system, and the strengthening of information security
      publicity and talent training. To offer a suitable platform and provide efficient
      solutions for the development of a public information service platform in the
      city, enhance the professional quality of research papers and dissertations, as
      well as the solutions' operability. More public services will be provided in a
      highly connected way across the boundaries between government, enterprises,
      society, and citizens and even form a public service market that accepts
      autonomous choices and becomes an important part of the digital economy, thus
      finding a good balance between economic development and social welfare.

AB  - Traditional text annotation-based video retrieval is done by manually labeling
      videos with text, which is inefficient and highly subjective and generally cannot
      accurately describe the meaning of videos. Traditional content-based video
      retrieval uses convolutional neural networks to extract the underlying feature
      information of images to build indexes and achieves similarity retrieval of video
      feature vectors according to certain similarity measure algorithms. In this
      paper, by studying the characteristics of sports videos, we propose the histogram
      difference method based on using transfer learning and the four-step method based
      on block matching for mutation detection and fading detection of video shots,
      respectively. By adaptive thresholding, regions with large frame difference
      changes are marked as candidate regions for shots, and then the shot boundaries
      are determined by mutation detection algorithm. Combined with the characteristics
      of sports video, this paper proposes a key frame extraction method based on
      clustering and optical flow analysis, and experimental comparison with the
      traditional clustering method. In addition, this paper proposes a key frame
      extraction algorithm based on clustering and optical flow analysis for key frame 
      extraction of sports video. The algorithm effectively removes the redundant
      frames, and the extracted key frames are more representative. Through extensive
      experiments, the keyword fuzzy finding algorithm based on improved deep neural
      network and ontology semantic expansion proposed in this paper shows a more
      desirable retrieval performance, and it is feasible to use this method for video 
      underlying feature extraction, annotation, and keyword finding, and one of the
      outstanding features of the algorithm is that it can quickly and effectively
      retrieve the desired video in a large number of Internet video resources,
      reducing the false detection rate and leakage rate while improving the fidelity, 
      which basically meets people's daily needs.

      topic is fragmented, mainly related to the hospitality and tourism industry. This
      manuscript aims to present scholarly research findings dealing with the
      post-Covid-19 management strategies in the hospitality and tourism industry from 
      January 1, 2020, to July 28, 2021. These strategies can play an essential role in
      the survival and growth of the sectors. The study identified and acknowledged the
      core contributing authors, journals, countries, affiliation, corresponding
      authors through bibliometric, citation, and keyword analysis. It also conducted
      the co-occurrence analysis and reported three significant research streams and
      bibliometric coupling to identify four research themes for management strategies 
      of the tourism and hospitality industry in the post-Covid era. With the help of
      an influential and conceptual framework, the study highlights the future
      challenges managers could face and suggests the possible area for reviewing and
      revising the existing policies by proposing future directions. Consequently, this
      study contributes to the current literature on post-Covid-19 management
      strategies and policies by developing the critical analysis of the extant
      literature and highlighting the understudy areas that future studies must explore
      to expand the scope of the research.

AB  - The purpose of this study was twofold: first, to be among the first attempts to
      validate linguistic analysis as a method of creativity assessment and second, to 
      differentiate between individuals in varying scientific and artistic creativity
      levels using personality language patterns. Creativity is most commonly assessed 
      through methods such as questionnaires and specific tasks, the validity of which 
      can be weakened by scorer or experimenter error, subjective and response biases, 
      and self-knowledge constraints. Linguistic analysis may provide researchers with 
      an automatic, objective method of assessing creativity, and free from human error
      and bias. The current study used 419 creativity text samples from a wide range of
      creative individuals mostly in science (and some in the arts and humanities) to
      investigate whether linguistic analysis can, in fact, distinguish between
      creativity levels and creativity domains using creativity dictionaries and
      personality dimension language patterns, from the linguistic inquiry and word
      count (LIWC) text analysis program. Creative individuals tended to use more words
      on the creativity keyword dictionaries as well as more introversion and openness 
      to experience language pattern words than less creative individuals. Regarding
      creativity domains, eminent scientists used fewer introversion, and openness to
      experience language pattern words than eminent artists. Text analysis through
      LIWC was able to partially distinguish between the three creativity levels, in
      some cases, and the two creativity domains (science and art). These findings lend
      support to the use of linguistic analysis as a partially valid assessment of
      scientific and artistic creative achievement.

PG  - 780542
LID - 10.3389/fpsyt.2021.780542 [doi]
AB  - Almost a century after Jacob Levy Moreno pioneered the group practice of
      psychodrama, research in this area has flourished to include different sub-fields
      of study and psychodramatic intervention for various psychological conditions. By
      making use of scientometric analysis, particularly document citation analysis and
      keyword analysis, this study maps out dominant research domains in psychodrama
      since its inception. From these findings, projections of future research trends
      and an evaluation of psychodrama research are discussed. Generally, there has
      been an increased adoption of technology to facilitate psychodrama practice,
      along with an increasing integration of psychodramatic principles with other
      psychotherapies. To improve research in this area, this paper recommends greater 
      transparency in the reporting of materials, processes and data used in
      publications. Finally, we encourage embracing new technological methods such as
      neuroimaging to provide greater insight into mechanisms of change in psychodrama.
      The field of psychodrama remains full of potential and innovations to be
      developed.

TI  - Supported Decision-Making in Persons With Dementia: Development of an Enhanced
      Consent Procedure for Lumbar Puncture.
PG  - 780276
LID - 10.3389/fpsyt.2021.780276 [doi]
AB  - The right to make autonomous decisions is enshrined in law. However, the question
      how persons with cognitive deficits can be enabled to make autonomous decisions
      has not been satisfactorily addressed. In particular, the concept of supported
      decision-making and its implementation into practice has been poorly explored for
      persons with dementia (PwD).This article describes the empirical development and 
      implementation of support tools to enhance informed consent processes (so called 
      enhanced consent procedures/ECP) for PwD on whether to undergo lumbar puncture.
      In the end of the process of pilot testing and further development of the tools, 
      the following tools were defined: (1) Standardized Interview Structure, (2)
      Elaborated Plain Language, (3) Ambience and Room Design, (4) Keyword Lists, (5)
      Priority Cards, (6) Visualization, and (7) Simplified Written Informed Consent
      (Patient Information), as well as the general attitude (8) Person-Centered
      Attitude of the facilitator. As the development, implementation and evaluation of
      ECP tools is one objective of the transnational ENSURE project, we also include
      an overview of future empirical procedures. So far, our findings can serve as a
      selection of possibilities to support PwD in decision-making and help
      practitioners achieve an appropriate balance between the autonomy and protection 
      of PwD in complex decision-making situation. Future studies should address the
      question if the proposed set of tools is effective to enhance informed consent
      processes in PwD.

AB  - The awareness of the plastic issue is rising in recent years. Our seas and
      coastal seawaters are investigated with the aim to evaluate the possible fate,
      behavior and the impact of these novel contaminants upon marine biota. In
      particular, benthic organisms are exposed to micro(nano)plastics that sink and
      accumulated on the seabed. Sea urchins can be prone to the plastic impact for all
      their lifespan with effect that can be extended upon the trophic cascade since
      their key role as grazer organisms. Moreover, they are largely used in the
      assessment of contaminant impact both as adult individuals and as early larval
      stages. This review analyzes the recent literature about the chemical and
      physical hazards posed by diverse polymers to sea urchins, in relation to their
      peculiar characteristics and to their size. The search was based on a query of
      the keyword terms: microplastic _ OR nanoplastic_AND Sea urchins in Web of
      Science and Google Scholar. The effects provoked by exposure of different sea
      urchin biological form are highlighted, considering both laboratory exposure and 
      collection in real world. Additional focus has also been given upon the exposure 
      methods utilized in laboratory test and in the existing limitations in the
      testing procedures. In conclusion, the micro(nano)plastics major impact seemed to
      be attributable to leaching compounds, however variability and lacking of
      realisms in the procedures do not allow a full understanding of the hazard posed 
      by micro(nano)plastics for sea urchins. Finally, the work provides insights into 
      the future research strategies to better characterize the actual risk for sea
      urchins.

AB  - Natural language processing (NLP), a domain of artificial intelligence (AI) that 
      models human language, has been used in medicine to automate diagnostics, detect 
      adverse events, support decision making and predict clinical outcomes. However,
      applications to the clinical neurosciences appear to be limited. NLP has matured 
      with the implementation of deep transformer models (e.g., XLNet, BERT, T5, and
      RoBERTa) and transfer learning. The objectives of this study were to (1)
      systematically review NLP applications in the clinical neurosciences, and (2)
      explore NLP analysis to facilitate literature synthesis, providing clear examples
      to demonstrate the potential capabilities of these technologies for a clinical
      audience. Our NLP analysis consisted of keyword identification, text
      summarization and document classification. A total of 48 articles met inclusion
      criteria. NLP has been applied in the clinical neurosciences to facilitate
      literature synthesis, data extraction, patient identification, automated clinical
      reporting and outcome prediction. The number of publications applying NLP has
      increased rapidly over the past five years. Document classifiers trained to
      differentiate included and excluded articles demonstrated moderate performance
      (XLNet AUC = 0.66, BERT AUC = 0.59, RoBERTa AUC = 0.62). The T5 transformer model
      generated acceptable abstract summaries. The application of NLP has the potential
      to enhance research and practice in the clinical neurosciences.

AB  - The recycling of spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is both essential to
      sustainable resource utilization and environmental conservation. While spent
      batteries possess a resource value, they pose an environmental hazard at the same
      time. Since the start of development to recycle spent LIBs in 1990s, important
      contributions have been made and a number of achievements have been accomplished 
      by scholars globally. Therefore, it is valuable to summarize the developments on 
      spent LIB recycling and to analyze the characteristics and trends
      comprehensively. A review of the progress in this field will provide guidance for
      future development. In this study, recycling characteristics and developing
      trends including the research foundation, milestone, research hotspot, key
      technologies, and emerging trends were identified based on visual scientometric
      analysis followed by a discussion on future research directions in this area. For
      the analysis, 1041 publications in English were collected, summarized, and
      categorized. The distribution of scientific publications on spent LIB recycling
      from 1995 to 2020 displayed an increasing trend in numbers. China made the
      biggest contribution with 528 publications and basically cooperated with all
      other countries. The research fields with the highest contributions were
      "engineering", "chemistry", and "environmental science and technology". The
      keywords recovery, lithium ion battery, and cobalt appeared in high frequency.
      "Metal value" was identified as the most frequently used keyword which began to
      burst in 2005 and ended in 2013.

TI  - Older adult recognition error patterns when listening to interrupted speech and
      speech in steady-state noise.
PG  - 3428
LID - 10.1121/10.0006975 [doi]
AB  - This study examined sentence recognition errors made by older adults in degraded 
      listening conditions compared to a previous sample of younger adults. We examined
      speech recognition errors made by older normal-hearing adults who repeated
      sentences that were corrupted by steady-state noise (SSN) or periodically
      interrupted by noise to preserve 33%, 50%, or 66% of the sentence. Responses were
      transcribed and coded for the number and type of keyword errors. Errors increased
      with decreasing preservation of the sentence. Similar sentence recognition was
      observed between SSN and the greatest amount of interruption (33%). Errors were
      predominately at the word level rather than at the phoneme level and consisted of
      omission or substitution of keywords. Compared to younger listeners, older
      listeners made more total errors and omitted more whole words when speech was
      highly degraded. They also made more whole word substitutions when speech was
      more preserved. In addition, the semantic relatedness of the substitution errors 
      to the sentence context varied according to the distortion condition, with
      greater context effects in SSN than interruption. Overall, older listeners made
      errors reflecting poorer speech representations. Error analyses provide a more
      detailed account of speech recognition by identifying changes in the type of
      errors made across listening conditions and listener groups.

TI  - Assessment of the quality of information on treatment of keratoconus on YouTube.
LID - 10.1007/s10792-021-02139-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the reliability, quality and effectiveness of YouTube videos
      addressing treatment of keratoconus. METHODS: This is a retrospective,
      cross-sectional and register-based study. A YouTube search was performed using
      the keyword treatment of keratoconus, and the first 100 videos that came out were
      included in the study. The numbers of views, likes, dislikes, comments, daily
      viewing rate (number of views per day), uploaded source (physicians, public or
      private institution, health channel or patients), country of origin, video type
      (patient experience, scholarly information), and described treatment technique
      (contact lens, corneal cross-linking, intrastromal corneal ring,
      topography-guided photorefractive keratectomy, keratoplasty) were evaluated for
      all videos. They were also evaluated regarding their DISCERN, Journal of the
      American Medical Association (JAMA), global quality score (GQS) and usefulness
      score by two independent ophthalmologists. RESULTS: Of the top 100 videos, 83
      videos met the criteria. The mean DISCERN, JAMA, GQS and usefulness score were
      42.92 +/- 18.14, 2.7 +/- 0.73, 3.07 +/- 1.25 and 2.99 +/- 1.44, respectively. Of 
      the 83 videos, 35(42.2%) had been uploaded by physicians, 19(22.9%) by patients, 
      15(18.1%) by health channel, and 14(16.9%) by institutions/private health
      institutions. In the correlation analysis, the four scoring systems showed a
      statistically significant and strong positive correlation with each other (p <
      0.001). In addition, viewing rate DISCERN, GQS, usefulness scores, number of
      likes, dislikes and comments showed a statistically significant positive
      correlation. CONCLUSION: The content of YouTube videos regarding treatment of
      keratoconus is of generally good quality and is educational for patients.
      Increasing the number of videos uploaded by healthcare professionals will
      increase the quality, reliability and informative features of the videos.

TI  - Power-Tool Use in Orthopaedic Surgery: Iatrogenic Injury, Its Detection, and
      Technological Advances: A Systematic Review.
LID - e21.00013 [pii]
LID - 10.2106/JBJS.OA.21.00013 [doi]
AB  - Background: Power tools are an integral part of orthopaedic surgery but have the 
      capacity to cause iatrogenic injury. With this systematic review, we aimed to
      investigate the prevalence of iatrogenic injury due to the use of power tools in 
      orthopaedic surgery and to discuss the current methods that can be used to reduce
      injury. Methods: We performed a systematic review of English-language studies
      related to power tools and iatrogenic injuries using a keyword search in MEDLINE,
      Embase, PubMed, and Scopus databases. Exclusion criteria included injuries
      related to cast-saw use, temperature-induced damage, and complications not
      clearly related to power-tool use. Results: A total of 3,694 abstracts were
      retrieved, and 88 studies were included in the final analysis. Few studies and
      individual case reports looked directly at the prevalence of injury due to power 
      tools. These included 2 studies looking at the frequency of vascular injury
      during femoral fracture fixation (0.49% and 0.2%), 2 studies investigating the
      frequency of vertebral artery injury during spinal surgery (0.5% and 0.08%), and 
      4 studies investigating vascular injury during total joint arthroplasty (1 study 
      involving 138 vascular injuries in 124 patients, 2 studies noting 0.13% and 0.1% 
      incidence, and 1 questionnaire sent electronically to surgeons). There are
      multiple methods for preventing damage during power-tool use. These include the
      use of robotics and simulation, specific drill settings, and real-time feedback
      techniques such as spectroscopy and electromyography. Conclusions: Power tools
      have the potential to cause iatrogenic injury to surrounding structures during
      orthopaedic surgery. Fortunately, the published literature suggests that the
      frequency of iatrogenic injury using orthopaedic power tools is low. There are
      multiple technologies available to reduce damage using power tools. In high-risk 
      operations, the use of advanced technologies to reduce the chance of iatrogenic
      injury should be considered. Level of Evidence: Therapeutic Level IV. See
      Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

TI  - The state of social science research on COVID-19.
PG  - 1-15
LID - 10.1007/s11192-021-04206-4 [doi]
AB  - Research on COVID-19 has proliferated rapidly since the outbreak of the pandemic 
      at the end of 2019. Many articles have aimed to provide insight into this
      fast-growing theme. The social sciences have also put effort into research on
      problems related to COVID-19, with numerous documents having been published. Some
      studies have evaluated the growth of scientific literature on COVID-19 based on
      scientometric analysis, but most of these analyses focused on medical research
      while ignoring social science research on COVID-19. This is the first
      scientometric study of the performance of social science research on COVID-19. It
      provides insight into the landscape, the research fields, and international
      collaboration in this domain. Data obtained from SSCI on the Web of Science
      platform was analyzed using VOSviewer. The overall performance of the documents
      was described, and then keyword co-occurrence and co-authorship networks were
      visualized. The six main research fields with highly active topics were confirmed
      by analysis and visualization. Mental health and psychology were clearly shown to
      be the focus of most social science research related to COVID-19. The USA made
      the most contributions, with the most extensive collaborations globally, with
      Harvard University as the leading institution. Collaborations throughout the
      world were strongly related to geographical location. Considering the social
      impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, this scientometric study is significant for
      identifying the growth of literature in the social sciences and can help
      researchers within this field gain quantitative insights into the development of 
      research on COVID-19. The results are useful for finding potential collaborators 
      and for identifying the frontier and gaps in social science research on COVID-19 
      to shape future studies.

TI  - Does Time of Day influence postural control and gait? A review of the literature.
PG  - 153-166

LID - 10.1016/j.gaitpost.2021.10.023 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Like many physiologic processes, Time of Day may influence postural
      control and gait. A better understanding of diurnal variations in postural
      control and gait may help to improve diagnoses, reduce falls, and optimize
      rehabilitation and training routines. This review summarizes the current
      literature that addresses these questions. RESEARCH QUESTION: Does time of day
      affect postural control and gait? METHODS: We searched PubMed, Google Scholar,
      and IEEE using a combination of keyword and MeSH terms. We included papers that
      studied human subjects and assessed gait or postural control as a function of
      time of day. We evaluated the quality of the identified papers based on nine
      assessment criteria and analyzed them considering the topic (postural control or 
      gait), age, and characteristics of the conducted assessments. We then
      quantitatively synthesized the results across studies using a meta-analytical
      approach (i.e., Hedges' g model). RESULTS: Twenty-two papers considered the
      relationship between time of day and postural control, and eleven considered the 
      relationship between time of day and gait. Six studies found that postural
      control was best in the morning, four described postural control being best in
      the afternoon, four described optimal postural control in the evening, and eight 
      reported no time of day effect. Two studies found gait best in the morning, five 
      described gait best in the afternoon, two described optimal gait in the evening, 
      and two reported no time of day effect. The results of the quantitative analysis 
      suggest that both postural control and gait were best in the evening.
      SIGNIFICANCE: While there is no clear consensus on whether there is a time of day
      effect for postural control and gait, the findings of this review provide initial
      evidence suggesting that a small but statistically significant effect exists in
      favor of the evening. Standardized testing, including repeated and continuous
      evaluations, may help provide more definitive information on time of day
      influences on postural control and gait.

TI  - Uncovering Research Trends of Phycobiliproteins Using Bibliometric Approach.
LID - 2358 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/plants10112358 [doi]
AB  - Phycobiliproteins are gaining popularity as long-term, high-value natural
      products which can be alternatives to synthetic products. This study analyzed
      research trends of phycobiliproteins from 1909 to 2020 using a bibliometric
      approach based on the Scopus database. The current findings showed that
      phycobiliprotein is a burgeoning field in terms of publications outputs with
      "biochemistry, genetics, and molecular biology" as the most related and focused
      subject. The Journal of Applied Phycology was the most productive journal in
      publishing articles on phycobiliproteins. Although the United States of America
      (U.S.A.) contributed the most publications on phycobiliproteins, the Chinese
      Academy of Sciences (China) is the institution with the largest number of
      publications. The most productive author on phycobiliproteins was Glazer,
      Alexander N. (U.S.A.). The U.S.A. and Germany were at the forefront of
      international collaboration in this field. According to the keyword analysis, the
      most explored theme was the optimization of microalgae culture parameters and
      phycobiliproteins extraction methods. The bioactivity properties and extraction
      of phycobiliproteins were identified as future research priorities. Synechococcus
      and Arthrospira were the most cited genera. This study serves as an initial step 
      in fortifying the phycobiliproteins market, which is expected to exponentially
      expand in the future. Moreover, further research and global collaboration are
      necessary to commercialize phycobiliproteins and increase the consumer
      acceptability of the pigments and their products.

TI  - Stimulated Expression of CXCL12 in Adrenocortical Carcinoma by the PPARgamma
      Ligand Rosiglitazone Impairs Cancer Progression.
LID - 1097 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jpm11111097 [doi]
AB  - Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare malignancy with poor prognosis when
      metastatic and scarce treatment options in the advanced stages. In solid tumors, 
      the chemokine CXCL12/CXCR4 axis is involved in the metastatic process. We
      demonstrated that the human adrenocortex expressed CXCL12 and its cognate
      receptors CXCR4 and CXCR7, not only in physiological conditions, but also in ACC,
      where the receptors' expression was higher and the CXCL12 expression was lower
      than in the physiological conditions. In a small pilot cohort of 22 ACC patients,
      CXCL12 negatively correlated with tumor size, stage, Weiss score, necrosis, and
      mitotic activity. In a Kaplan-Meier analysis, the CXCL12 tumor expression
      significantly predicted disease-free, progression-free, and overall survival. In 
      vitro treatment of the primary ACC H295R and of the metastatic MUC-1 cell line
      with the PPARgamma-ligand rosiglitazone (RGZ) dose-dependently reduced
      proliferation, resulting in a significant increase in CXCL12 and a decrease in
      its receptors in the H295R cells only, with no effect on the MUC-1 levels. In ACC
      mouse xenografts, tumor growth was inhibited by the RGZ treatment before tumor
      development (prevention-setting) and once the tumor had grown
      (therapeutic-setting), similarly to mitotane (MTT). This inhibition was
      associated with a significant suppression of the tumor CXCR4/CXCR7 and the
      stimulation of human CXCL12 expression. Tumor growth correlated inversely with
      CXCL12 and positively with CXCR4 expression, suggesting that local CXCL12 may
      impair the primary tumor cell response to the ligand gradient that may contribute
      to driving the tumor progression. These findings indicate that CXCL12/CXCR4 may
      constitute a potential target for anti-cancer agents such as rosiglitazone in the
      treatment of ACC.

TI  - A Systematic Survey of Characteristic Features of Yeast Cell Death Triggered by
      External Factors.
LID - 886 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jof7110886 [doi]
AB  - Cell death in response to distinct stimuli can manifest different morphological
      traits. It also depends on various cell death signaling pathways, extensively
      characterized in higher eukaryotes but less so in microorganisms. The study of
      cell death in yeast, and specifically Saccharomyces cerevisiae, can potentially
      be productive for understanding cell death, since numerous killing stimuli have
      been characterized for this organism. Here, we systematized the literature on
      external treatments that kill yeast, and which contains at least minimal data on 
      cell death mechanisms. Data from 707 papers from the 7000 obtained using keyword 
      searches were used to create a reference table for filtering types of cell death 
      according to commonly assayed parameters. This table provides a resource for
      orientation within the literature; however, it also highlights that the common
      view of similarity between non-necrotic death in yeast and apoptosis in mammals
      has not provided sufficient progress to create a clear classification of cell
      death types. Differences in experimental setups also prevent direct comparison
      between different stimuli. Thus, side-by-side comparisons of various cell
      death-inducing stimuli under comparable conditions using existing and novel
      markers that can differentiate between types of cell death seem like a promising 
      direction for future studies.

TI  - Health Policies Based on Patient Satisfaction: A Bibliometric Study.
LID - 1520 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/healthcare9111520 [doi]
AB  - Healthcare decision-makers increasingly face a changing and ever-evolving
      landscape, forcing them to formulate public policies based on the results from
      different scientific investigations. This article evaluates the field of research
      on patient satisfaction as a basis for health policies. The analysis was carried 
      out with a sample of 621 articles published between 2000 and 2020 in the Scopus
      database. The world's largest producer and research co-operator on patient
      satisfaction and health policy was the United States. However, the most prolific 
      authors, institutions, and journals are of British origin. Regarding the themes, 
      we find that, in economic and management matters, scientific production is
      scarce. To study the evolution of keywords, we divided the study period into two 
      periods of an equal number of years. In both sub-periods, the keyword "Human"
      stands out. In the second sub-period, the word "Perception" stands out, which
      indicates the current attention paid to the patient's opinion.

TI  - Evaluating the Usefulness of YouTube as a Source of Patient Information for
      Neurosurgical Care in Africa: A Study Protocol.
PG  - 244-249
LID - 10.29337/ijsp.168 [doi]
AB  - Background: A significant proportion of the public rely on the internet for their
      health information, and social media has emerged as the principal information
      source. YouTube is the world's largest and most popular video library, and it has
      emerged as a primary health information source because it offers animated and
      interactive content. However, little is known of its usefulness of neurosurgery
      videos to African YouTube users. We aim with this study to evaluate the
      usefulness of YouTube as a source of patient information for neurosurgical care
      in Africa. Methodology: This observational study will be conducted using YouTube.
      A search will be carried out to identify neurosurgery videos suggested to African
      YouTube viewers from inception to September 2021. An internet browser (Google
      Chrome, Google Inc., CA, USA) with its cache cleared will be used to execute the 
      search. The default YouTube search setting of "relevance" will be used to
      replicate what a search attempt performed by a patient would be. The first 50
      results from each keyword search will be registered in a Microsoft Excel
      spreadsheet (Microsoft, WA, USA). The primary outcome measure is the reliability 
      of the videos. Data will be analyzed using SPSS version 26 (IBM, WA, USA). Odds
      ratios and their 95% confidence intervals will be calculated. The statistically
      significant level will be set at 0.05. Also, a linear regression analysis will be
      performed to examine the effects of independent variables on continuous dependent
      variables. Dissemination: The study findings will be published in an academic
      peer-reviewed journal, and the abstract will be presented at an international
      conference. English and French visual and video abstracts of the methods and key 
      findings will be designed and disseminated widely on social media. Highlights: A 
      significant proportion of the public rely on the internet and social media for
      health information.YouTube has emerged as the world's largest video library, and 
      has emerged as a primary health information source.There are few safeguards to
      avoid dissemination of false or biased information on the platform this could
      negatively influence health seeking behaviorWe aim to evaluate the usefulness of 
      YouTube as a source of patient information for neurosurgical care in Africa.The
      findings of this study will help evaluate the volume and quantity of African
      neurosurgical video content and identify best practices.

TI  - Predicting the Number of Suicides in Japan Using Internet Search Queries: Vector 
      Autoregression Time Series Model.
PG  - e34016
LID - 10.2196/34016 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The number of suicides in Japan increased during the COVID-19
      pandemic. Predicting the number of suicides is important to take timely
      preventive measures. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to clarify whether the number of 
      suicides can be predicted by suicide-related search queries used before searching
      for the keyword "suicide." METHODS: This study uses the infoveillance approach
      for suicide in Japan by search trends in search engines. The monthly number of
      suicides by gender, collected and published by the National Police Agency, was
      used as an outcome variable. The number of searches by gender with queries
      associated with "suicide" on "Yahoo! JAPAN Search" from January 2016 to December 
      2020 was used as a predictive variable. The following five phrases highly
      relevant to suicide were used as search terms before searching for the keyword
      "suicide" and extracted and used for analyses: "abuse"; "work, don't want to go";
      "company, want to quit"; "divorce"; and "no money." The augmented Dickey-Fuller
      and Johansen tests were performed for the original series and to verify the
      existence of unit roots and cointegration for each variable, respectively. The
      vector autoregression model was applied to predict the number of suicides. The
      Breusch-Godfrey Lagrangian multiplier (BG-LM) test, autoregressive conditional
      heteroskedasticity Lagrangian multiplier (ARCH-LM) test, and Jarque-Bera (JB)
      test were used to confirm model convergence. In addition, a Granger causality
      test was performed for each predictive variable. RESULTS: In the original series,
      unit roots were found in the trend model, whereas in the first-order difference
      series, both men (minimum tau 3: -9.24; max tau 3: -5.38) and women (minimum tau 
      3: -9.24; max tau 3: -5.38) had no unit roots for all variables. In the Johansen 
      test, a cointegration relationship was observed among several variables. The
      queries used in the converged models were "divorce" for men (BG-LM test: P=.55;
      ARCH-LM test: P=.63; JB test: P=.66) and "no money" for women (BG-LM test: P=.17;
      ARCH-LM test: P=.15; JB test: P=.10). In the Granger causality test for each
      variable, "divorce" was significant for both men (F104=3.29; P=.04) and women
      (F104=3.23; P=.04). CONCLUSIONS: The number of suicides can be predicted by
      search queries related to the keyword "suicide." Previous studies have reported
      that financial poverty and divorce are associated with suicide. The results of
      this study, in which search queries on "no money" and "divorce" predicted
      suicide, support the findings of previous studies. Further research on the
      economic poverty of women and those with complex problems is necessary.

TI  - Examining the Academic Trends in Neuropsychological Tests for Executive Functions
      Using Virtual Reality: Systematic Literature Review.
PG  - e30249
LID - 10.2196/30249 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In neuropsychology, fully immersive virtual reality (VR) has been
      spotlighted as a promising tool. It is considered that VR not only overcomes the 
      existing limitation of neuropsychological tests but is also appropriate for
      treating executive functions (EFs) within activities of daily living (ADL) due to
      its high ecological validity. While fully immersive VR offers new possibilities
      of neuropsychological tests, there are few studies that overview the intellectual
      landscape and academic trends in the research related to mainly targeted EFs with
      fully immersive VR. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to get an overview 
      of the research trends that use VR in neuropsychological tests and to analyze the
      research trends using fully immersive VR neuropsychological tests with
      experimental articles. METHODS: This review was carried out according to
      Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
      guidelines. Articles were searched in three web databases using keywords related 
      to VR, EFs, and cognitive abilities. The study was conducted in two steps,
      keyword analysis and in-depth systematic review. In the web database search from 
      2000 to 2019, 1167 articles were initially collected, of which 234 articles in
      the eligibility phase were used to conduct keyword analysis and a total of 47
      articles were included for systematic review. RESULTS: In keyword analysis, the
      number of articles focused on dementia including the keywords "MCI," "SCD," and
      "dementia" were highlighted over the period, rather than other symptoms. In
      addition, we identified that the use of behavioral and physiological data in
      virtual environments (VEs) has dramatically increased in recent studies. In the
      systematic review, we focused on the purpose of study, assessment, treatment, and
      validation of usability and structure. We found that treatment studies and
      uncategorized studies including presence and cybersickness issues have emerged in
      the recent period. In addition, the target symptoms and range of participants
      were diversified. CONCLUSIONS: There has been a continuously increasing interest 
      in dealing with neuropsychology by using fully immersive VR. Target cognitive
      abilities have been diversified, as well as target symptoms. Moreover, the
      concept of embodied cognition was transplanted in this research area.

TI  - What do patents tell us about microalgae in agriculture?
PG  - 154
LID - 10.1186/s13568-021-01315-4 [doi]
AB  - Microalgae have been used widely as a biological source for several industries,
      such as biofuel, pharmaceutical and food. Recently, the agricultural industry has
      also began using microalgae as an alternative source for sustainable products to 
      replace agrochemicals. Due to the lack of scientific articles in this research
      area, the objective of this study was to search for applications of microalgae
      and to characterize its use in agriculture using the patent documents available
      in three patent databases, World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO),
      European Patent Office (EPO) and Brazilian Institute of Industrial Property
      (INPI). The search was carried out using the keyword "microalgae" and applying
      the filter for International Patent Classification (IPC) code "A01N" which
      corresponds to patents related to agriculture and cultivation of microalgae. Our 
      patent database search returned 669 documents and 132 patents were selected for
      the study based on their abstracts. The first patent was registered in 1982 and
      described the use of microalgae Chlorella extract as a plant growth promoter.
      After that, no patent was registered for 15 years. From 2005 to 2014, only seven 
      patents were found. However, the scenario changed from 2015 when the number of
      patents increased mainly in the United States, China and Europe. The patent
      analysis showed several applications for microalgae in the agricultural sector,
      such as plant growth promotion, biofertilization, plant disease control, weed
      management, and post-harvest quality. This review confirmed the increasing
      interest in microalgae-derived products in agriculture and the value of using
      patent documents to assess innovative areas.

TI  - Menstrual Cycle Phase, Hormonal Contraception, and Alcohol Consumption in
      Premenopausal Females: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 745263
LID - 10.3389/fgwh.2021.745263 [doi]
AB  - Women may be particularly vulnerable to alcohol harm, but many current theories
      fail to acknowledge the unique factors that influence female alcohol use. The
      biological mechanisms underlying female alcohol consumption have largely been
      unexplored, although recently the menstrual cycle has been highlighted as a
      potentially important factor. This systematic review, using a narrative
      synthesis, examined the association between the menstrual cycle phases on alcohol
      consumption and aimed to determine whether hormonal contraception influences this
      association. The review follows PRISMA and SWiM guidelines, registration number: 
      CRD42018112744. Electronic searches were conducted in the relevant databases with
      keyword (e.g., "menstrua(*)"; "alcohol"). Thousand six hundred and sixty-two
      titles were identified, 16 of which were included in the review. Results were
      inconsistent regarding whether an association between menstrual cycle phase and
      alcohol consumption was found. Furthermore, there was inconsistency regarding
      which phase was associated with higher consumption, and different factors were
      reported to have moderated the direction, e.g., family history of alcohol use
      disorder (AUD), premenstrual syndrome (PMS). These conflicting results may be
      partly explained by variability in both study quality and design, and differences
      in measurement of cycle phase and alcohol consumption. More robust research is
      needed before conclusions can be drawn with regard to the role of the menstrual
      cycle and hormonal contraception on female drinking behavior. This review
      provides recommendations to strengthen research in this area.

TI  - Determining the credibility, accuracy and comprehensiveness of websites educating
      consumers on complex regional pain syndrome accessible in Australia: a systematic
      review.
PG  - 485-495
LID - 10.1071/PY21066 [doi]
AB  - Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a distressing and disabling pain
      condition. Many people with CRPS and the health professionals who treat them seek
      information about the condition via the Internet. The credibility, accuracy and
      comprehensiveness of online CRPS information remains unknown. The aim of this
      study was to determine the credibility, accuracy and comprehensiveness of
      information presented on freely accessible websites that aim to educate people
      about CRPS. Keyword searches were conducted on the Australian Google site, with
      'trustworthy' websites included and critically appraised. Primary outcomes were
      recognised metrics of credibility (JAMA benchmark credibility criteria) and
      website accuracy (according to European CRPS guidelines). Comprehensiveness was
      assessed using the proportion of European CRPS guidelines covered by the
      websites. In all, 30 websites with 819 recommendations were critically appraised.
      Five (17%) websites met all credibility criteria; of the recommendations, 349
      (43%) were accurate, 252 (31%) were inaccurate and 218 (26%) were unclear. For
      comprehensiveness, an average of 17% of general guidelines, 15% of therapeutic
      guidelines and 6% of medication/supplement guidelines were covered. Online
      information about CRPS available to Australians has low credibility, accuracy and
      comprehensiveness. Many website recommendations are inaccurate or unclear, and
      many websites endorse inappropriate treatments. There is an urgent need for
      accurate and comprehensive sources of CRPS information online.

TI  - Study on Horizon Scanning by Citation Network Analysis and Text Mining: A Focus
      on Drug Development Related to T Cell Immune Response.
PG  - 230-243
LID - 10.1007/s43441-021-00351-3 [doi]
AB  - Certain innovative technologies applied to medical product development require
      novel evaluation approaches and/or regulations. Horizon scanning for such
      technologies will help regulators prepare, allowing earlier access to the product
      for patients and an improved benefit/risk ratio. This study investigates whether 
      citation network analysis and text mining of scientific papers could be a tool
      for horizon scanning in the field of immunology, which has developed over a long 
      period, and attempts to grasp the latest research trends. As the result of the
      analysis, the academic landscape of the immunology field was identified by
      classifying 90,450 papers (obtained from PubMED) containing the keyword "immune* 
      and t lymph*" into 38 clusters. The clustering was indicative of the research
      landscape of the immunology field. To confirm this, immune checkpoint inhibitors 
      were used as a retrospective test topic of therapeutics with new mechanisms of
      action. Retrospective clustering around immune checkpoint inhibitors was found,
      supporting this approach. The analysis of the research trends over the last 3 to 
      5 years in this field revealed several candidate topics, including ARID1A gene
      mutation, CD300e, and tissue resident memory T cells, which shows notable
      progress and should be monitored for future possible product development. Our
      results have demonstrated the possibility that citation network analysis and text
      mining of scientific papers can be a useful objective tool for horizon scanning
      of life science fields such as immunology.

TI  - Umbilical artery thrombosis diagnosed at different gestational ages and fetal
      outcomes: a case series.
PG  - 788
LID - 10.1186/s12884-021-04264-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Umbilical artery thrombosis is a rare complication of pregnancy
      strongly associated with poor fetal and perinatal outcomes, such as intrauterine 
      asphyxia, fetal growth restriction, and stillbirth. Its pathogenesis remains
      unclear, and there is the added challenge of selecting an appropriate delivery
      time to achieve excellent neonatal outcomes. METHODS: Our Hospital is a critical 
      maternal rescue center with approximately 7000 births annually. We present a
      series of 8 cases of umbilical artery thrombosis diagnosed at the hospital
      between Apr 1, 2018, and Jan 31, 2020. We identified the cases through a keyword 
      search of the maternity and pathology information management systems. RESULTS:
      Three patients were diagnosed with a transabdominal ultrasound scan and hypoxia
      on fetal heart monitoring. All three patients had emergency cesarean section
      delivery. Four patients were observed closely for 5 to 13 weeks from initial
      detection by an ultrasound scan to delivery. Only one patient was diagnosed after
      vaginal delivery by Hematoxylin-eosin staining of umbilical cord sections. Seven 
      patients had deliveries by cesarean section, and one patient had a vaginal
      delivery. All infants were born alive. CONCLUSIONS: Umbilical artery thrombosis
      is a challenging and rare condition that can occur at different gestational ages,
      especially when diagnosed in the third trimester and accompanied by fetal growth 
      restriction. Consequently, these patients require close monitoring of umbilical
      blood flow and fetal growth and intervention at the appropriate time to achieve
      an optimal outcome.

TI  - Management of "torus" or "buckle" fractures of the distal radius: a systematic
      review.
LID - 10.1007/s11845-021-02801-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Torus fractures, also known as buckle fractures, of the distal radius
      are a very common reason for presentation to emergency departments. Traditional
      approaches to their management involved immobilisation in a circumferential cast 
      but the evidence now supports the use of removable splints with or without
      radiological and clinical follow-up. Unfortunately current practice conflicts
      with the evidence base and there is no guideline which highlights all the
      evidence as one clear, concise management protocol. METHODS: An online review of 
      Pubmed, EMBASE, Biomed, and the Cochrane library using keyword searches combining
      "radius", "torus", "buckle" and "fracture" was performed. All prospective,
      retrospective or randomised trials involving the management of distal radius
      torus fractures in patients aged 0-18 years were included. Our outcomes focused
      on 5 aspects of patient care: immobilisation method and duration, clinical
      follow-up, radiological follow-up and the use of diagnostic ultrasound. RESULTS: 
      The initial search identified 143 papers which following application of the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria 21 articles were deemed eligible. A Cochrane
      review and 8 systematic reviews were also identified and manually searched for
      missed articles and this yielded a further 3 articles. CONCLUSIONS: Current
      research indicates that torus fractures should be managed with a removable splint
      supplied in A&E and worn for 3 weeks. There is no need for fracture clinic
      follow-up or repeat radiological imaging once patients are given adequate
      information at the time of diagnosis. This would represent both an economical and
      resource saving for patients, parents and the health service.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Irish Travelling community are an ethnic minority group known for
      their distinct identity, traditions and language. Although this group has its
      roots in Ireland, they are marginalised and discriminated against by every part
      of Irish society. Irish Travellers are a group who are vulnerable to exclusion
      and experience health, economic and educational inequalities. Young female Irish 
      Travellers in Ireland are highly susceptible to mental illnesses which makes the 
      engagement of this ethnic group by healthcare services important. AIMS: To review
      the cases of three female adolescents from the Irish Travelling community living 
      in Ireland with a focus on their psycho-social difficulties. Complete a
      literature review, to complement and inform the three cases reviewed, on the
      socio-cultural and mental health challenges which effect adolescent females in
      the Irish Travelling community. METHODS: Case series with literature search and
      review of relevant published articles using a keyword search of databases PubMed,
      PsycINFO and HSE protocols and reports. Hand searching of relevant references
      utilised. Informed signed consent obtained from each patient attending child and 
      adolescent services in Ireland. Signed parental consent also obtained. Written
      consent obtained due to the use of patient history and assessments in the case
      series. RESULTS: Adolescent females within the Irish Travelling community
      encounter particular difficulties within the moral constraints and expectations
      of this community. They encounter specific issues including mental illness,
      sexual stigma, domestic violence and limitations to the role of women. The three 
      cases outlined give representative examples of the challenges faced by adolescent
      females within the Travelling community. CONCLUSIONS: Psychiatric services need
      to be aware of this vulnerable group and focus on the recognition of their needs 
      within the context of their community.

TI  - Floating-Harbor Syndrome Treated With Recombinant Human Growth Hormone: A Case
      Report and Literature Review.
PG  - 747353
LID - 10.3389/fped.2021.747353 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: We aimed to summarize the clinical characteristics of
      Floating-Harbor syndrome (FHS) and the effect of recombinant human growth hormone
      (rhGH) to increase height. Methods: The clinical manifestations, gene sequencing 
      results, treatment, and regression of one child with FHS were reported at the
      Department of Pediatrics, General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, in July
      2020. PubMed was searched using the keyword "Floating-Harbor Syndrome" up to
      March 2021 to obtain clinical information on children with FHS for review.
      Results: The child, who was a male aged 6 years and 9 months, presented to the
      clinic with main complaints of delayed language development since childhood and a
      short stature for 4 years. The child's short stature, peculiar facial features,
      delayed language development, and delayed bone development were considered
      alongside genetic testing and Sanger sequencing to verify the results. A
      heterozygous mutation (c.7401delC; p.Ile2468Phefs(*)7) was identified in exon 34 
      of the SRCAP gene, which was a frameshift mutation, and Sanger verification
      showed that neither parent had this mutation. The child was administered
      subcutaneous injection of rhGH (0.13 U/kg/day) and was followed up regularly. At 
      the time of writing, the child had been treated for 6 months and was 7 years and 
      3 months old with a height of 106.3 cm (-3.69 SDS), which was a height increase
      of 6.3 cm. The patient did not complain of discomfort during treatment and
      presented normal laboratory tests results. Twenty-two children with FHS treated
      with rhGH were included in the literature review, and most of these patients
      demonstrated an increase in height SDS without adverse effects. Conclusion: Short
      stature, delayed skeletal maturation, impaired language expression, intellectual 
      deficits, and peculiar facial features are the main clinical features of FHS.
      rhGH can be used as a treatment to increase height in patients with FHS, but its 
      effectiveness and safety still need to be monitored in larger sample sizes over
      longer periods of time.

TI  - How to Classify, Teach, and Learn Ophthalmic Eponyms.
PG  - e18849
LID - 10.7759/cureus.18849 [doi]
AB  - Introduction There are limited educational studies on effective ways to teach and
      learn medical eponyms. While there is no consensus on how to best address this
      issue, developing novel strategies to teach medical eponyms has become critical
      in many branches of medicine, including ophthalmology. Materials & Methods An
      ophthalmologic eponymic database was created using eight source texts (e.g.,
      books, encyclopedias, and dictionaries) and included the year the eponym was
      introduced, related name, nationality, specialty, and the eponym's description.
      PubMed database with a Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) keyword for "eponym" and
      "eye" and "ophthalmology" and a Google search for a combination of related
      keywords was also performed. A careful biographical search was conducted for each
      name in the second phase to obtain further biographical details. Inclusion
      criteria for eponyms in the dataset were: i) named after at least one person, ii)
      identified as a specific medical term in the literature, iii) related to any
      field of medicine. Names derived from art, history, mythology, patient, family,
      chemistry, botany (or other fields outside of medicine) were excluded. The three 
      authors independently screened to eliminate duplicated names and ensure eligible 
      names met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results A total of 1,257 unique
      ophthalmologic eponyms representing 8.8% of 14,332 medical eponyms were
      identified. Three-hundred fifty-one of 743 (47.2%) eponyms were named after
      ophthalmologists representing 36 countries. The United States of America and
      Germany comprised the largest fraction of nationalities (40.2%), not necessarily 
      representing their birthplace. Signs, syndromes, and diseases composed the
      largest category (45.8%) of eponymous ophthalmologic names. Discussion The
      current volume of eponymous names impedes the ability of a learner to retain this
      information. Classifying eponyms based on form, intention, or function, provides 
      a more refined method for placing eponyms in their respective categories.
      Teaching eponyms by enumerating their historical content, demonstrating the
      correct performance of the eponym, assessing the technique, and providing
      feedback, affords the learner a more fruitful and meaningful learning experience.
      Understanding the context of the signs, syndrome, or techniques further allows
      the learner to gain insights into the clinical application of eponyms in
      diagnostic decision-making. Conclusion The teaching model proposed incorporates
      key aspects that may facilitate retention and recall of the eponymous name. The
      model includes imparting historical knowledge about the person who described the 
      sign, technique, or process; demonstrating the correct procedure as originally
      reported; and coaching to ensure that the appropriate skill is mastered. Before
      abandoning eponyms, it is first necessary to understand their efficacy,
      effectiveness, usefulness, and role in clinical medicine.

TI  - Chaotic lipoma with proximal syrinx -a (not so) rare variant - review of the
      literature, possible embryology and management.
PG  - 1-9
LID - 10.1080/02688697.2021.2005777 [doi]
AB  - Chaotic lipomas are an extremely rare variant of spinal lipomas. This entity was 
      first defined in 2009 by Pang and colleagues. Not much has been written about
      this variant. Its characteristic is the haphazard distribution of DREZ (Dorsal
      root entry zone), nerve roots and placode-lipoma interface. Thus
      complete/near-total excision of this lesion is quite difficult. We describe a
      case of chaotic spinal lipoma and elucidate the challenges faced in the
      management of this entity and review the literature. We performed a thorough
      systematic review with the keyword 'chaotic', 'Lipomyelomeningocele', 'Complex
      Lipomyelomeningocele', 'LMMC', 'Lumbar lipoma', 'spinal lipoma' in the google
      scholar and PUBMED data system for indexed literature on the above topic with no 
      particular time frame. The studies quoted range earliest from 1970 till
      currently. Additional potential relevant articles were further retrieved through 
      a manual search of references from original reports. Out of 42 studies, a total
      of 21 publications were selected which could have encountered a chaotic variant, 
      but due to the term introduced only recently in 2009, may have been described
      differently. Studies encompassing true lipomeningomyelocele were excluded from
      our review. What we found out? Chaotic lipoma may not be a new entity. The scarce
      description in literature may be in part due to non-introduction and unclear
      description of this term earlier. The management of this variant is particularly 
      challenging with basic principles remaining the same. Meticulous near-total
      excision and placode-lipoma construct are the major obstacles.

TI  - Structural and functional analysis of CCT family genes in pigeonpea.
PG  - 217-226
LID - 10.1007/s11033-021-06860-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L.) is a photoperiod-sensitive short-day
      plant. Understanding the flowering-related genes is critical to developing
      photoperiod insensitive cultivars. METHODS: The CCT family genes were identified 
      using 'CCT DOMAIN PROTEIN' as a keyword and localized on the chromosomes using
      the BLAST search option available at the LIS database. The centromeric positions 
      were identified through BLAST search using the centromeric repeat sequence of C. 
      cajan as a query against the chromosome-wise FASTA files downloaded from the NCBI
      database. The CCT family genes were classified based on additional domains and/or
      CCT domains. The orthologous and phylogenetic relationships were inferred using
      the OrthoFinder and MEGA 10.1 software, respectively. The CCT family genes'
      expression level in photoperiod-sensitive and insensitive genotypes was compared 
      using RNA-seq data and qRT-PCR analysis. RESULTS: We identified 33 CCT family
      genes in C. cajan distributed on ten chromosomes and nine genomic scaffolds. They
      were classified into CMF-type, COL-type, PRR-type, and GTCC- type. The CCT family
      genes of legumes exhibited an extensive orthologous relationship. Glycine max
      showed the maximum similarity of CCT family genes with C. cajan. The expression
      analysis of CCT family genes using photoperiod insensitive (ICP20338) and
      photoperiod sensitive (MAL3) genotypes of C. cajan demonstrated that CcCCT4 and
      CcCCT23 are the active CONSTANS in ICP20338. In contrast, only CcCCT23 is active 
      in MAL3. CONCLUSION: The CCT family genes in C. cajan vary considerably in
      structure and domain types. They are maximally similar to soybean's CCT family
      genes. The differential photoperiod response of pigeonpea genotypes, ICP20338 and
      MAL3, is possibly due to the difference in the number and types of active
      CONSTANS in them.

TI  - Developments, Focuses, and Trends in Early-Onset Scoliosis From 2005 to 2020: A
      Systematic Bibliometric Analysis.
LID - S1878-8750(21)01746-0 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.wneu.2021.11.044 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although several studies have been reported on early-onset scoliosis
      (EOS), a bibliometric analysis is still lacking. A systematic bibliometric
      analysis will enable researchers to understand the scope of the research topics, 
      identify research focuses and key literature, and predict future research
      directions. METHODS: Literature data were retrieved from the Web of Science Core 
      Collection database. The Web of Science Results Analysis and Citation Report were
      used to analyze the reported studies in different views. CiteSpace and VOSviewer 
      were used for further analysis, including a cooperation network analysis of the
      authors, institutions, countries and/or regions, discipline and journal analysis,
      reference co-citation analysis, and keyword co-occurrence analysis. RESULTS: The 
      final analysis included 674 relevant studies reported from 2005 to 2020. During
      the study period, the field of EOS has expanded rapidly. Multiple cooperation was
      found among the authors, institutions, and countries and/or regions, with some
      making great contributions. The results of the reference co-citation analysis
      showed that the studies had several main focuses, including the growing rod (GR),
      magnetically controlled GR, an EOS 24-item questionnaire, and a growth
      evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: From 2005 to 2020, surgical treatment has remained the
      focus of research in the EOS field. The magnetically controlled GR is the latest 
      research focus, which might become more comprehensive in the future. The Gr has
      remained the most popular topic, and potential new surgical techniques might
      require improvement to become the favored techniques. In addition, assessing the 
      health-related quality of life and growth parameters of patients with EOS have
      become a popular topic.

TI  - Visualization and analysis of mapping knowledge domains for the global transition
      towards clean cooking: a bibliometric review of research output from 1990 to
      2020.
LID - 10.1007/s11356-021-17340-6 [doi]
AB  - Current statistics report that 2.6 billion households across the globe rely on
      polluting and inefficient cooking fuels and technologies, posing
      death-threatening health risks to people mainly from developing
      countries/regions. Several studies on clean cooking have been conducted with the 
      emergence of international organizations such as the Clean Cooking Alliance to
      raise awareness. In the current study, a bibliometric tool, CiteSpace, was
      employed to analyze the 877 documents retrieved from the SCI-EXPANDED, SSCI, and 
      A&HCI databases on clean cooking research from 1990 to 2020. The results reveal
      that interest in clean cooking research took a sharp rise in the last decade,
      especially after 2016. The research field has become increasingly
      interdisciplinary but has mostly centered on environment, energy, and health. The
      most productive countries/regions in this field are the USA, India, England, and 
      China. The keyword and citation analyses indicate that research in this field
      mostly focuses on adverse impacts of household air pollution from unclean cooking
      fuels and technologies on the environment and public health particularly, in
      developing countries/regions. Also, the drivers and barriers to the large-scale
      adoption of clean cooking fuels and technologies have become a topic of interest 
      in recent years. The three most studied clean cooking fuels among various regions
      are LPG, biogas, and electricity. This study synthesizes global research on clean
      cooking and may be beneficial to other researchers in understanding current
      trends in this field and serve as a guide for concentrating on the most important
      topics.

TI  - Microalgae cultivation in wastewater from agricultural industries to benefit next
      generation of bioremediation: a bibliometric analysis.
LID - 10.1007/s11356-021-17427-0 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to provide a bibliometric analysis and mapping of
      existing scientific papers, focusing on microalgae cultivation coupled with
      biomass production and bioremediation of wastewater from agricultural industries,
      including cassava, dairy, and coffee. Using the Web of Science (WoS) database for
      the period 1996-2021, a search was performed using a keyword strategy, aiming at 
      segregating the papers in groups. For the first search step, the keywords
      "wastewater treatment", AND "microalgae", AND "cassava" OR "dairy" OR "coffee"
      were used, resulting in 59 papers. For the second step, the keywords "wastewater 
      treatment" AND "biomass productivity" AND "microalgae" AND "economic viability"
      OR "environmental impacts" were used, which resulted in 34 articles. In these
      papers, keywords such as "carbon dioxide biofixation" and "removal of nutrients
      by the production of biomass by microalgae" followed by "environmental and
      economic impacts" were highlighted. Some of these papers presented an analysis of
      the economic feasibility of the process, which reveal the state-of-the-art setup 
      required to make the cultivation of microalgae economically viable. Researches
      focusing on the efficiency of microalgae biomass harvesting are needed to improve
      the integration of microalgae production in industrial eco-parks using wastewater
      to achieve the global goal of bioremediation and clean alternatives for renewable
      energy generation.

TI  - A Literature Review: The History of Psychological Impact of Illness amongst
      People with Leprosy (PwL) in Countries across the Globe.
PG  - 5519608
LID - 10.1155/2021/5519608 [doi]
AB  - Background: Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease for which effective therapy
      has been long since invented. Thus, the morbidity has been decreased as
      technology has advanced, but the permanent disability has continuously generated 
      stigma for centuries. The stigma causes the emergence of a poor psychological
      impact on people with leprosy (PwL). These impacts make new PwL reluctant to get 
      appropriate therapy for their initial symptoms and are, thus, troublesome in
      accomplishing the goals of the leprosy elimination program. The aim of this
      review is to provide the history of psychological impact amongst PwL in countries
      across the globe. Methods: This is a literature review study. A keyword-based
      search was conducted in digital libraries. Articles reporting on PwL's psychology
      and related issues, such as quality of life, opportunity of building a marriage, 
      and getting hired, were included. The data were presented based on a leprosy
      history timeline with cutoff points, namely, the invention of promin (1941) and
      multidrug treatment (1970). Results: In total, 38 studies were included in this
      review. These studies showed that PwL's knowledge towards leprosy has been
      increasing; nevertheless, their attitude is still lacking. The emotional response
      was described by various negative feelings that had persistently occurred. These 
      poor psychological impacts were followed by poor treatment-seeking behavior and
      resulted in low quality of life. Conclusions: From year to year, the PwL's
      knowledge about leprosy has been getting better; nevertheless, their attitude
      towards the disease is still poor. The emotional response, social participation, 
      and quality of life of PwL are persistently poor due to the persistent stigma.

AB  - One serious pandemic can nullify years of efforts to extend life expectancy and
      reduce disability. The coronavirus pandemic has been a perturbing factor that has
      provided an opportunity to assess not only the effectiveness of health systems
      for cardio-vascular diseases (CVD), but also their sustainability. The goal of
      our research is to analyze the influence of public health factors on the
      mortality from circulatory diseases using machine learning methods. We analysed a
      very large dataset that consisted of the information collected from the national 
      registers in Russia. We included data from 2015 to 2021. It included 340 factors 
      that characterize organization of healthcare in Russia. The resulting area under 
      receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC of ROC) of the Random Forest based
      regression model was 92% with a testing dataset. The models allow for automated
      retraining as time passes and epidemiological and other situations change. They
      also allow additional characteristics of regions and health care organizations to
      be added to existing training datasets depending on the target. The developed
      models allow the calculation of the probability of the target for 6-12 months
      with an error of 8%. Moreover, the models allow to calculate scenarios and the
      value of the target indicator when other indicators of the region change.

TI  - Development and Validation of a Deep Learning Model for Earlier Detection of
      Cognitive Decline From Clinical Notes in Electronic Health Records.
PG  - e2135174
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.35174 [doi]
AB  - Importance: Detecting cognitive decline earlier among older adults can facilitate
      enrollment in clinical trials and early interventions. Clinical notes in
      longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) provide opportunities to detect
      cognitive decline earlier than it is noted in structured EHR fields as formal
      diagnoses. Objective: To develop and validate a deep learning model to detect
      evidence of cognitive decline from clinical notes in the EHR. Design, Setting,
      and Participants: Notes documented 4 years preceding the initial mild cognitive
      impairment (MCI) diagnosis were extracted from Mass General Brigham's Enterprise 
      Data Warehouse for patients aged 50 years or older and with initial MCI diagnosis
      during 2019. The study was conducted from March 1, 2020, to June 30, 2021.
      Sections of notes for cognitive decline were labeled manually and 2 reference
      data sets were created. Data set I contained a random sample of 4950 note
      sections filtered by a list of keywords related to cognitive functions and was
      used for model training and testing. Data set II contained 2000 randomly selected
      sections without keyword filtering for assessing whether the model performance
      was dependent on specific keywords. Main Outcomes and Measures: A deep learning
      model and 4 baseline models were developed and their performance was compared
      using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and area
      under the precision recall curve (AUPRC). Results: Data set I represented 1969
      patients (1046 [53.1%] women; mean [SD] age, 76.0 [13.3] years). Data set II
      comprised 1161 patients (619 [53.3%] women; mean [SD] age, 76.5 [10.2] years).
      With some overlap of patients deleted, the unique population was 2166. Cognitive 
      decline was noted in 1453 sections (29.4%) in data set I and 69 sections (3.45%) 
      in data set II. Compared with the 4 baseline models, the deep learning model
      achieved the best performance in both data sets, with AUROC of 0.971 (95% CI,
      0.967-0.976) and AUPRC of 0.933 (95% CI, 0.921-0.944) for data set I and AUROC of
      0.997 (95% CI, 0.994-0.999) and AUPRC of 0.929 (95% CI, 0.870-0.969) for data set
      II. Conclusions and Relevance: In this diagnostic study, a deep learning model
      accurately detected cognitive decline from clinical notes preceding MCI diagnosis
      and had better performance than keyword-based search and other machine learning
      models. These results suggest that a deep learning model could be used for
      earlier detection of cognitive decline in the EHRs.

      literature examining sex differences in TBI is highly contradictory with some
      reporting better outcomes in men, others reporting better outcomes in women, and 
      others reporting mixed results or no difference. While the exact cause is
      currently debated, the existence of such differences has important implications
      for surveillance techniques, treatment options, and management of long-term
      consequences. As the number of women within the U.S. military ranks increases and
      with the opening of combat roles to women in 2013, increased awareness of
      probable sex differences regarding TBI responses will enable better standard of
      care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the PubMed database, a keyword search using
      gender, "sex factors", "sex dependent", "gender disparity", TBI, "traumatic brain
      injury", mTBI (mild TBI), and "cranial trauma" was used to identify articles of
      interest. Results were filtered for written in the last 5 years, English, and
      free full text. References of relevant articles were cross-checked for additional
      publications. Articles familiar to the authors were also included. RESULTS: We
      review literature that includes analysis of age as an interaction in TBI,
      hypothesized mechanisms to explain variations in outcomes between men and women, 
      and the need for inclusion of sex as a criterion in future studies. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Emerging studies underscore the complexity of interpreting sex differences in
      TBI. The long-held belief that women have a neuroprotective advantage compared to
      men based on higher levels of sex hormones is being re-evaluated. Past
      conclusions have relied extensively on clinical studies that include a
      disproportionate number of men or do not stratify results based on sex. While sex
      hormones may be neuroprotective, underlying mechanisms are far from clarified.
      Future TBI studies must include women and gonadal hormone levels should be
      measured to address potential variables. Given the significant number of TBIs
      within the military, an improved understanding of TBI pathophysiology and
      outcomes is important considerations for mission success and servicemember
      longevity.

AB  - Background: To deal with the large disparity across disciplines using impact
      factor, which is widely used in hospitals and has recently come under attack for 
      distorting good scientific practices, we propose a set of systematic methods to
      improve the equality of research evaluations of various clinical disciplines.
      Methods: We used bibliometric information on 18 clinical disciplines from 2016 to
      2018. We first sought to clarify disciplinary characteristics with the aim of
      identifying the characteristic fields for each clinical discipline, and we
      constructed a keyword database. To minimize the disparity across various clinical
      disciplines, we used normalized evaluation, referring to the calculation of the
      normalized coefficient of a specific discipline, to enable a relatively clear
      evaluation across different disciplines. Results: Feature extraction was
      performed, and over 700,000 journals were retrieved each year. Using this
      information, the journal correlation coefficient was calculated. From 2016 to
      2018, oncology had the largest normalized coefficient (0.133, 0.136, 0.146
      respectively), which reflects the highest correlation between the characteristic 
      journals of the discipline. The findings showed a clear distinction in journal
      coverage and journal correlations for different disciplines. Conclusions: The new
      evaluation indicator and normalized process measure different features of
      disciplines, providing a basis for the further balancing of evaluations, and
      considering differences across disciplines.

      Disease.
PG  - 795-801
LID - 10.5863/1551-6776-26.8.795 [doi]
AB  - Vedolizumab is a humanized alpha4beta7-integrin antagonist that is currently
      FDA-approved for adult inflammatory bowel disease. Limited evidence is available 
      to guide use in pediatric patients, though off-label use is described in the form
      of retrospective reviews and case series. Collectively these publications begin
      to establish safety and efficacy data in pediatric patients < 18 years of age.
      Additionally, dosing regimens described in the literature serve to guide
      weight-based dosing, which is not established at this time. This narrative review
      aims to summarize the available literature and provide recommendations for
      vedolizumab use in the pediatric population. A literature search was performed in
      PubMed (January 2014-December 2020) using the keyword vedolizumab. Based on the
      available evidence, vedolizumab appears to be a safe and moderately effective
      agent for treatment of refractory pediatric inflammatory bowel disease.
      Prospective, randomized trials are warranted to optimize dosing regimens and to
      establish long-term safety.

TI  - Women's Authorship of Reviews in Ophthalmic Journals Over Time.
PG  - 590-594
LID - 10.1097/APO.0000000000000444 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate prevalence and trends in women's authorship of articles
      in ophthalmic review journals over 2 decades. DESIGN: Literature survey. METHODS:
      Total number of authors, and number and gender of first and senior (last-named)
      authors, were identified in all full reviews published in Prog Retin Eye Res,
      Surv Ophthalmol, and Curr Opin Ophthalmol for the calendar years 1999, 2009, and 
      2019. The gender of authors was assigned manually by multiple methods. The
      subspecialty area of each review was captured by keyword and text search. Country
      of origin was determined from attributions of first and senior authors. RESULTS: 
      The gender of 841 first and senior authors was assigned unequivocally for 471
      articles (96%). The frequency of women's authorship rose significantly over time 
      (1999, 2009, 2019) for both first authors (19%, 32%, 44%; P < 0.001) and senior
      authors (16%, 19%, 29%; P = 0.018). The number of single-author reviews decreased
      significantly over time (P < 0.001), as did the proportion of reviews with
      neither a first nor a senior woman author (P < 0.001). Women's first authorship
      increased over time for reviews on glaucoma (P < 0.001), while women's senior
      authorship increased for anterior segment/cataract (P = 0.036). The proportion of
      reviews with a woman first or senior author did not differ by country of origin
      (P = 0.887 and P = 0.520, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Women's authorship of
      articles in ophthalmic review journals increased significantly over the 20-year
      period, but a gender disparity remained: in 2019, more than 55% of first authors,
      and more than 70% of senior authors, were men.

TI  - Brain is modulated by neuronal plasticity during postnatal development.
PG  - 34
LID - 10.1186/s12576-021-00819-9 [doi]
AB  - Neuroplasticity is referred to the ability of the nervous system to change its
      structure or functions as a result of former stimuli. It is a plausible mechanism
      underlying a dynamic brain through adaptation processes of neural structure and
      activity patterns. Nevertheless, it is still unclear how the plastic neural
      systems achieve and maintain their equilibrium. Additionally, the alterations of 
      balanced brain dynamics under different plasticity rules have not been explored
      either. Therefore, the present article primarily aims to review recent research
      studies regarding homosynaptic and heterosynaptic neuroplasticity characterized
      by the manipulation of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. Moreover, it
      attempts to understand different mechanisms related to the main forms of synaptic
      plasticity at the excitatory and inhibitory synapses during the brain development
      processes. Hence, this study comprised surveying those articles published since
      1988 and available through PubMed, Google Scholar and science direct databases on
      a keyword-based search paradigm. All in all, the study results presented
      extensive and corroborative pieces of evidence for the main types of plasticity, 
      including the long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of the 
      excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs and IPSPs).

TI  - Insights in Neuropsychiatry: Suicide and Self-Mutilation in the Mena Region- a
      Bibliometric Quantitative and Co-occurrence Medline-Based Analysis.
PG  - e18680
LID - 10.7759/cureus.18680 [doi]
AB  - Background Little is known about self-mutilation and suicide-related research in 
      the Arab world. Aim We aim to quantify research activity related to suicide and
      self-mutilation, according to socio-economic factors, and assess inter-regional
      collaborations and trends of topics in the Arab world in the last 16 years.
      Methods A search was conducted through the PubMed database to find articles
      related to suicide and self-mutilation, according to author affiliation in the 22
      Arab countries between 2004 and 2019 (inclusive), and standardized according to
      mean population, suicide, and self-mutilation disability associated life years
      (DALY), and gross domestic product (GDP). VOS Viewer was used for keyword and
      organization co-occurrence analysis. Results Only 0.61% of articles related to
      suicide and self-mutilation published between 2004 and 2019 were of Arab origin, 
      compared to 1.76% in South America and 7.94% in Far East Asia. Suicide and
      self-mutilation articles make up 0.09% of the total publications in the Arab
      region. Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Lebanon had the highest number of published
      articles related to suicide and self-mutilation. When comparing publications per 
      million persons, Lebanon and Kuwait ranked first with 5.15 and 3.40 publications 
      per million persons. Lebanon showed the highest number of publications per USD
      billion GDP, with 0.75 publications. The highest number of publications per 1%
      self-injury-related DALY was recorded in Saudi Arabia, with 46.97 publications.
      In recent years, VOS Viewer revealed poor inter-regional collaborations and a
      modest but increasing trend towards depression, poisoning, and cross-sectional
      studies. Conclusion Despite increasing publications, the region still lags in
      terms of suicide and self-mutilation research activity. A pan-Arab strategy
      should be implemented to refine suicide-related research and increase mental
      health awareness.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a comprehensive post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC)
      symptom lexicon (PASCLex) from clinical notes to support PASC symptom
      identification and research. METHODS: We identified 26,117 COVID-19 positive
      patients from the Mass General Brigham's electronic health records (EHR) and
      extracted 328,879 clinical notes from their post-acute infection period (day
      51-110 from first positive COVID-19 test). PASCLex incorporated Unified Medical
      Language System(R) (UMLS) Metathesaurus concepts and synonyms based on selected
      semantic types. The MTERMS natural language processing (NLP) tool was used to
      automatically extract symptoms from a development dataset. The lexicon was
      iteratively revised with manual chart review, keyword search, concept
      consolidation, and evaluation of NLP output. We assessed the comprehensiveness of
      PASCLex and the NLP performance using a validation dataset and reported the
      symptom prevalence across the entire corpus. RESULTS: PASCLex included 355
      symptoms consolidated from 1520 UMLS concepts of 16,466 synonyms. NLP achieved an
      averaged precision of 0.94 and an estimated recall of 0.84. Symptoms with the
      highest frequency included pain (43.1%), anxiety (25.8%), depression (24.0%),
      fatigue (23.4%), joint pain (21.0%), shortness of breath (20.8%), headache
      (20.0%), nausea and/or vomiting (19.9%), myalgia (19.0%), and gastroesophageal
      reflux (18.6%). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: PASC symptoms are diverse. A
      comprehensive lexicon of PASC symptoms can be derived using an ontology-driven,
      EHR-guided and NLP-assisted approach. By using unstructured data, this approach
      may improve identification and analysis of patient symptoms in the EHR, and
      inform prospective study design, preventative care strategies, and therapeutic
      interventions for patient care.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Therapeutic/clinical inertia is thought to be responsible for up to
      80% of cardiovascular events. This study was conducted as a comprehensive scoping
      and bibliometric analysis of peer-reviewed scholarly documents reporting on
      factors associated with therapeutic/clinical inertia in caring for patients with 
      hypertension. Additionally, this study identified the factors associated with
      therapeutic/clinical inertia in hypertension. STUDY DESIGN: This study was a
      scoping and bibliometric analysis. METHODS: The databases MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase,
      CINAHL/EBSCO, Cochrane, and Scopus were searched from inception to September 23, 
      2020, using relevant keywords. Documents reporting on factors associated with
      therapeutic/clinical inertia in caring for patients with hypertension were
      selected based on inclusion criteria. Bibliometric indicators and VOSviewer were 
      used to analyze and map citation and keyword networks. RESULTS: Data were
      collected from 71 documents. Of those, 43 (60.6%) were original articles, 54
      (76.1%) were published after 2010, and 41 (57.7%) originated from the United
      States. Mapping cooccurrence of terms identified 112 hot topics that were grouped
      into 4 clusters. A total of 41 factors associated with therapeutic/clinical
      inertia were identified from the documents selected. Of those, 23 (56.1%) were
      related to the physician, 12 (29.3%) were related to the patient, and 6 (14.6%)
      were related to the health care system. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping and
      bibliometric study provides insights into the width and depth of scholarly
      peer-reviewed documents on factors associated with therapeutic/clinical inertia
      in caring for patients with hypertension. Findings of this study could be helpful
      in shaping future directions of research into therapeutic/clinical inertia in
      hypertension.

PG  - S28-S39
LID - 10.1080/10790268.2021.1971357 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify cases of spinal cord injury or disease (SCI/D) in an
      Ontario database of primary care electronic medical records (EMR). DESIGN: A
      reference standard of cases of chronic SCI/D was established via manual review of
      EMRs; this reference standard was used to evaluate potential case identification 
      algorithms for use in the same database. SETTING: Electronic Medical Records
      Primary Care (EMRPC) Database, Ontario, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 48,000 
      adult patients was randomly selected from 213,887 eligible patients in the EMRPC 
      database. INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Candidate algorithms were 
      evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV),
      negative predictive value (NPV), and F-score. RESULTS: 126 cases of chronic SCI/D
      were identified, forming the reference standard. Of these, 57 were cases of
      traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI), and 67 were cases of non-traumatic spinal
      cord injury (NTSCI). The optimal case identification algorithm used free-text
      keyword searches and a physician billing code, and had 70.6% sensitivity
      (61.9-78.4), 98.5% specificity (97.3-99.3), 89.9% PPV (82.2-95.0), 94.7% NPV
      (92.8-96.3), and an F-score of 79.1. CONCLUSIONS: Identifying cases of chronic
      SCI/D from a database of primary care EMRs using free-text entries is feasible,
      relying on a comprehensive case definition. Identifying a cohort of patients with
      SCI/D will allow for future study of the epidemiology and health service
      utilization of these patients.

TI  - Not Just for Dancing? A Content Analysis of Concussion and Head Injury Videos on 
      TikTok.
PG  - 692613
LID - 10.3389/fspor.2021.692613 [doi]
AB  - Social media platforms are an accessible and increasingly used way for the public
      to gather healthcare-related information, including on sports injuries. "TikTok" 
      is currently one of the fastest-growing social media platforms worldwide, and it 
      is especially popular amongst adolescents and young adults. The widespread use
      and popularity of TikTok suggests that this platform has potential to be a source
      for healthcare information for younger individuals. The aim of this study was to 
      gain a preliminary understanding of the concussion/head injury-related
      information on TikTok, and to gauge if TikTok could serve as a platform for
      concussion education. This exploratory study used a systematic search strategy to
      understand more about how concussion is being portrayed through TikTok videos.
      Using the keywords "concussion" and "head injury," 200 videos were downloaded
      from TikTok and 43 videos were excluded. Of the 92 videos retrieved using the
      keyword "concussion," 95% (n = 88) had more than 100,000 views and 6% (n = 10)
      had been viewed more than 10 million times. Over half, 54% (n = 50) of the
      "concussion" videos depicted individuals "playing around" and getting hit in the 
      head, whilst only 1% (n = 1) of the TikTok videos were categorized as "explaining
      concussion facts." The large numbers of views of concussion-related TikTok videos
      demonstrates the popularity of this platform and indicates that healthcare
      organizations should consider TikTok as a potential means for concussion
      education amongst younger individuals.

AB  - When an emergency occurs, effective decisions should be made in a limited time to
      reduce the casualties and economic losses as much as possible. In the past
      decades, emergency decision-making (EDM) has become a research hotspot and a lot 
      of studies have been conducted for better managing emergency events under tight
      time constraint. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive bibliometric
      analysis of the literature on this topic. The objective of this paper is to
      provide academic community with a complete bibliometric analysis of the EDM
      researches to generate a global picture of developments, focus areas, and trends 
      in the field. A total of 303 journal publications published between 2010 and 2020
      were identified and analyzed using the VOSviewer in regard to cooperation
      network, co-citation network, and keyword co-occurrence network. The findings
      indicate that the annual publications in this research field have increased
      rapidly since 2014. Based on the cooperation network and co-citation network
      analyses, the most productive and influential countries, institutions,
      researchers, and their cooperation networks were identified. Using the
      co-citation network analysis, the landmark articles and the core journals in the 
      EDM area are found out. With the help of the keyword co-occurrence network
      analysis, research hotspots and development of the EDM domain are determined.
      According to current trends and blind spots in the literature, possible
      directions for further investigation are finally suggested for EDM. The
      literature review results provide valuable information and new insights for both 
      scholars and practitioners to grasp the current situation, hotspots and future
      research agenda of the EDM field.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to identify and analyze the 100 most-cited
      articles published in orthodontic scientific journals in the past 21 years.
      METHODS: The research was conducted in the Thomson Reuters Web of Science data
      citation index, considering articles from 2000 to 2020 and the category of
      dentistry, oral surgery, and medicine. Information about the number of citations,
      citations per year, title, authors, year of publication, the title of scientific 
      journals, type of study, keywords, and thematic field were extracted for each
      article. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed to evaluate the
      collected data. The Pearson correlation analysis was used to explore the
      relationship between publication and the number of citations received. The
      VOSviewer software (Leiden University Center for Science and Technology Studies, 
      Leiden, the Netherlands) was used to generate the keyword cooccurrence network.
      RESULTS: The number of citations of the 100 selected articles ranged from 122 to 
      547. The journal with the largest number of cited articles was the American
      Journal of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics. Most of the papers were
      cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, and the most frequent thematic fields
      among the selected articles were anchorage, root resorption, and rapid maxillary 
      expansion. Orthodontic treatment, anchorage, and root resorption were the most
      frequent keywords. CONCLUSIONS: Bibliometric analysis of citations revealed a
      greater centralization of orthodontic studies. Most of the articles were
      published in a single journal and by one country. Anchorage is a trending topic
      in orthodontics, and cross-sectional and longitudinal studies are the most-cited 
      types of papers.

TI  - Mobile devices and wearable technology for measuring patient outcomes after
      surgery: a systematic review.
PG  - 157
LID - 10.1038/s41746-021-00525-1 [doi]
AB  - Complications following surgery are common and frequently occur the following
      discharge. Mobile and wearable digital health interventions (DHI) provide an
      opportunity to monitor and support patients during their postoperative recovery. 
      Lack of high-quality evidence is often cited as a barrier to DHI implementation. 
      This review captures and appraises the current use, evidence base and reporting
      quality of mobile and wearable DHI following surgery. Keyword searches were
      performed within Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and WHO Global Index
      Medicus databases, together with clinical trial registries and Google scholar.
      Studies involving patients undergoing any surgery requiring skin incision where
      postoperative outcomes were measured using a DHI following hospital discharge
      were included, with DHI defined as mobile and wireless technologies for health to
      improve health system efficiency and health outcomes. Methodological reporting
      quality was determined using the validated mobile health evidence reporting and
      assessment (mERA) guidelines. Bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration 
      tool for randomised studies or MINORS depending on study type. Overall, 6969
      articles were screened, with 44 articles included. The majority (n = 34)
      described small prospective study designs, with a high risk of bias demonstrated.
      Reporting standards were suboptimal across all domains, particularly in relation 
      to data security, prior patient engagement and cost analysis. Despite the
      potential of DHI to improve postoperative patient care, current progress is
      severely restricted by limitations in methodological reporting. There is an
      urgent need to improve reporting for DHI following surgery to identify patient
      benefit, promote reproducibility and encourage sustainability.

TI  - Toothbrushes as a Source of DNA for Gender and Human Identification-A Systematic 
      Review.
LID - 11182 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph182111182 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have reported the use of toothbrushes as a reliable
      source of DNA for human or gender identification. The present systematic review
      with the available information was conducted to answer the focus question "Is a
      toothbrush a reliable source of DNA for human or gender identification?".
      METHODS: The keyword combination "Toothbrush" and "DNA" was used to search
      databases including MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science along with a manual
      search of reference lists of relevant articles. Duplicates and irrelevant
      articles were excluded, and the remaining articles were fully read for the final 
      selection of articles. The risk of bias of the included studies was evaluated
      using the Appraisal tool for Cross-Sectional Studies (AXIS tool). RESULTS: Of the
      130 articles obtained, 122 duplicates or irrelevant articles were eliminated.
      Following the full-text reading of eight articles, five articles were selected
      based on eligibility criteria. The five studies reported that a toothbrush is a
      good source of DNA irrespective of the time interval. In a few studies some
      samples were not sufficient for complete DNA profiling due to factors such as the
      method of DNA extraction. CONCLUSION: Although a toothbrush is an excellent
      source of DNA for human and gender identification, future studies with a larger
      sample size, appropriate control group, and standardized technique of DNA
      extraction need to be conducted. Additionally, factors influencing the quantity
      and quality of DNA in toothbrushes need to be determined with standardized
      techniques.

TI  - Trends and Frontiers of Research on Cancer Gene Therapy From 2016 to 2020: A
      Bibliometric Analysis.
PG  - 740710
LID - 10.3389/fmed.2021.740710 [doi]
AB  - Background: With rapid development in molecular biology techniques and a greater 
      understanding of cancer pathogenesis, the growing attention has been concentrated
      on cancer gene therapy, with numerous articles on this topic published in recent 
      5 years. However, there is lacking a bibliometric analysis of research on cancer 
      gene therapy. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to conduct a
      bibliometric analysis to provide the trends and frontiers of research on cancer
      gene therapy during 2016-2020. Methods: We utilized CiteSpace 5.7.R5 software to 
      conduct a bibliometric analysis of publications on cancer gene therapy published 
      during 2016-2020. The bibliometric records were obtained from the Web of Science 
      Core Collection. Results: A total of 4,392 papers were included in the
      bibliometric analysis. Materials Science and Nanoscience and Nanotechnology took 
      an increasing part in the field of cancer gene therapy. Additionally, WANG W was 
      the most productive author, while ZHANG Y ranked top in terms of citations.
      Harvard Medical School and Sichuan University ranked top in the active
      institutions. P NATL ACAD SCI USA was identified as the core journal in the field
      of cancer gene therapy. "Ovarian cancer" was found to be the latest keyword with 
      the strongest burst. The keyword analysis suggested that the top three latest
      clusters were labeled "gene delivery," "drug delivery," and "gene therapy." In
      the reference analysis, cluster#2 labeled "gene delivery" held a dominant place
      considering both the node volume and mean year. Conclusion: The academic
      attention on cancer gene therapy was growing at a dramatically high speed.
      Materials Science and Nanoscience and Nanotechnology might become promising
      impetus for the development of this field. "Gene delivery" was thought to best
      reflect the research frontier on cancer gene therapy. The top-cited articles on
      gene delivery were focused on several novel non-viral vectors due to their
      specialty compared with viral vectors. "Ovarian cancer" was likely to be the
      potential research direction. These findings would help medical workers conduct
      further investigations on cancer gene therapy.

TI  - The Role of Talker Variability in Nonnative Phonetic Learning: A Systematic
      Review and Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 4802-4825
LID - 10.1044/2021_JSLHR-21-00181 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: High-variability phonetic training (HVPT) has been found to be effective
      on adult second language (L2) learning, but results are mixed in regards to the
      benefit of multiple talkers over single talker. This study provides a systematic 
      review with meta-analysis to investigate the talker variability effect in
      nonnative phonetic learning and the factors moderating the effect. METHOD: We
      collected studies with keyword search in major academic databases including
      EBSCO, ERIC, MEDLINE, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses, Elsevier, Scopus, Wiley
      Online Library, and Web of Science. We identified potential participant-,
      training-, and study-related moderators and conducted a random-effects model
      meta-analysis for each individual variable. RESULTS: On the basis of 18 studies
      with a total of 549 participants, we obtained a small-level summary effect size
      (Hedges' g = 0.46, 95% confidence interval [CI; 0.08, 0.84]) for the immediate
      training outcomes, which was greatly reduced (g = -0.04, 95% CI [-0.46, 0.37])
      after removal of outliers and correction for publication bias, whereas the effect
      size for immediate perceptual gains was nearly medium (g = 0.56, 95% CI [0.13,
      1.00]) compared with the nonsignificant production gains. Critically, the summary
      effect sizes for generalizations to new talkers (g = 0.72, 95% CI [0.15, 1.29])
      and for long-term retention (g = 1.09, 95% CI [0.39, 1.78]) were large. Moreover,
      the training program length and the talker presentation format were found to
      potentially moderate the immediate perceptual gains and generalization outcomes. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our study presents the first meta-analysis on the role of talker
      variability in nonnative phonetic training, which demonstrates the heterogeneity 
      and limitations of research on this topic. The results highlight the need for
      further investigation of the influential factors and underlying mechanisms for
      the presence or absence of talker variability effects. Supplemental Material

TI  - Pressure ulcers in patients with diabetes: a bibliometrics analysis.
PG  - 10515-10526
LID - 10.21037/apm-21-2757 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pressure ulcers (PU) refer to local tissue ulceration and necrosis
      caused by long-term compression and friction brought on by tissue ischemia and
      hypoxia. Diabetic wounds do not easily heal, and once a pressure ulceration
      occurs, it is difficult to deal with. The purpose of this study was to analyze
      the current research status of PUs in diabetic patients. METHODS: The Science
      Citation Index Expanded (SCI-E) database was searched with terms of "Pressure
      Ulcer" and "Diabetes". Citespace software was used to analyze the annual
      distribution of the number of target documents and the distribution of countries,
      institutions, journals, authors, and keywords used in these works. RESULTS: In
      all, 1271 documents were retrieved, with a total citation frequency of 47,081,
      and an h-index of 101. The top 5 countries in terms of the number of publications
      were the United States, the United Kingdom, China, Australia, and the
      Netherlands; the top 5 countries in centrality were the Netherlands, the United
      States, Canada, Japan, and France. The institutions with the greatest number of
      publications were the University of Amsterdam, Cardiff University, The University
      of Washington, and the University of Manchester. The institutions with the
      highest centrality were the University of Amsterdam, the University of Groningen,
      the University of Washington, the University of Adelaide, Baylor College of
      Medicine, and Queensland University of Technology. The authors with a highest
      number of publications were Bus SA, Apelqvist J, and the International Working
      Group on the Diabetic Foot, and Hinchliffe RJ. Only 2 authors had a centrality
      score above 0.01. Journals such as Diabetes Metabolism Research and Reviews,
      Diabetes Care, and Journal of Wound Care showed considerable influence in this
      field. Keyword analysis indicated that the use of keywords in this field is not
      uniform, and the focus of research on PUs in diabetic patients lies the risk and 
      management of foot ulcers. CONCLUSIONS: There are few studies concerning PUs in
      patients with diabetes and little collaboration between authors. The current
      focus in this field is on the risk and management of foot ulcers.

TI  - AECOPD research in the past ten years: a bibliographic analysis based on Web of
      Science.
PG  - 10401-10413
LID - 10.21037/apm-21-2756 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD
      (AECOPD) can cause a significant decrease in patient lung function, and are the
      main reason for hospitalization and death of patients with COPD. This study aims 
      to use bibliometric methods to analyze the characteristics of AECOPD related
      research in the past 10 years [2010-2020] and provide references for future
      research. METHODS: This study used subject terms to search AECOPD-related
      documents published in 2010-2020 in the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-E)
      database. The search terms were "AECOPD" or "acute exacerbation of chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease." We use the CiteSpace software to analyze the
      target literature records. The analysis includes: the annual distribution of
      literature publications, the distribution of published literature sources
      (including countries, institutions, journals, and authors), and using keywords.
      RESULTS: A total of 3,785 articles on AECOPD were published between 2010 and
      2020, with 62,162 citations. Both the number of published documents and the
      number of citations has increased with time. The literature mainly comes from
      several developed countries, including European and North American countries, and
      the cooperation between institutions and authors in these countries is relatively
      close. The main journals are the top journals of respiratory specialty and the
      top comprehensive journals. The results of the keyword analysis show that the
      current research is on risk factors, biomarkers, and AECOPD management.
      CONCLUSIONS: AECOPD research tends to focus on a precise diagnosis and treatment,
      and prevention of AECOPD in patients with COPD should be paid more attention.

TI  - A systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of preoperative exercise
      intervention on rehabilitation after total knee arthroplasty.
PG  - 10986-10996
LID - 10.21037/apm-21-2670 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A number of researches indicated preoperative functional exercise may
      improve the rehabilitation progress. This study aimed to investigate the effect
      of preoperative exercise intervention on rehabilitation before total knee
      arthroplasty (TKA) by literature retrieval and meta-analysis. METHODS: Embase,
      Cochrane library, PubMed, Ovid, and ClinicalTrials.gov were selected as the
      search database platforms. All published English articles related to preoperative
      exercise of TKA from January 2000 to January 2021 were searched with the
      following keyword strategy: ("preoperative functional exercise" or
      "prehabilitation exercise") AND ("TKA" or "total knee arthroplasty"). After
      literature screened according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the risk
      of bias and quality of the included articles were evaluated. RevMan 5.3.5
      software was used for analysis to obtain the forest plot and funnel plot.
      RESULTS: A total of 911 articles were preliminarily searched in this study, and
      12 were finally included for the quantitative analysis, comprising 889 patients; 
      the result showed after intervention, the experimental group patients had wider
      ROM flexion than the control group patients [mean difference (MD) =4.28; 95% CI: 
      2.28 to 6.28; Z=4.19; P<0.0001]; the experimental group patients were with higher
      quadriceps strength value than the control group (MD =1.86, 95% CI: 0.58-3.15;
      Z=2.84, P=0.005); the WOMAC score (The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities 
      Osteoarthritis Index), were higher for the experimental group patients (MD
      =-10.59; 95% CI: -11.88 to -9.29; Z=16.03; P<0.00001); and the standing and
      walking test index are higher (MD =-1.29, 95% CI: -1.90 to -0.67; Z=4.08;
      P<0.001); the quality of life score were higher too for the experimental group
      patients (MD =1.66; 95% CI: 1.13-2.20; Z=6.08; P<0.00001). DISCUSSION:
      Preoperative exercise intervention before TKA can improve knee flexion and
      flexibility, reduce inflammatory pain and stiffness, improve muscle strength,
      improve joint function, and thus improve the quality of life of patients.

TI  - A systematic review and meta-analysis of efficacy and safety of negative pressure
      wound therapy in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcer.
PG  - 10830-10839
LID - 10.21037/apm-21-2476 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is one of the new modality for
      the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. In this article we will investigate the
      efficacy and safety of it by literature search and meta-analysis. METHODS: The
      databases of PubMed, Embase, Ovid, and Cochrane library were selected as search
      platforms. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published after 2010 were searched
      with the keyword "vacuum-assisted closure therapy" OR "negative pressure wound
      therapy" OR "diabetic foot". The Cochrane Review Handbook was used to assess the 
      bias of the literatures. The software RevMan 5.4 was used for analysis to obtain 
      a forest plot and funnel plot. RESULTS: In this study, 363 articles were
      initially screened, and 9 literatures were finally included, involving a total of
      943 patients. Combined analysis using the fixed effects model showed that the
      healing rate of the NPWT group was significantly lower than the standard group
      [odds ratio (OR) =3.60, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.38 to 5.45, P<0.001]. The
      granulation tissue formation time of the NPWT group was significantly less than
      the standard group [mean difference (MD) =-8.95, 95% CI: -10.26 to -7.64,
      P<0.001]. The rate of adverse events of both groups showed no significant
      difference (OR =0.49, 95% CI: 0.10 to 2.42, P=0.38). The amputation rate of both 
      groups showed no statistically significant (OR =0.33, 95% CI: 0.09 to 1.26,
      P=0.10) too. DISCUSSION: Negative pressure wound therapy can effectively
      accelerate wound healing, it is equally safe with general routine treatment.
      However, the negative pressure value should be appropriately maintained and
      adjusted to avoid bleeding tendency of the wound when applying this new modality.

AB  - By searching the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of acupuncture and
      moxibustion from CNKI since its inception date to december 31 of 2019, the
      development status and hot trend of RCTs of acupuncture and moxibustion in China 
      were summarized. The CiteSpace and VOSviewer software were used to perform
      keyword co-occurrence analysis, clustering analysis, time-zone analysis and
      citation-burst analysis, and visual map was drawn. As a result, a total of 60 995
      articles were included, which were published in 1027 academic journals with 1787 
      keywords. The publication date was from 1975 to 2019. During the past 45 years,
      the publications of RCTs on acupuncture and moxibustion had shown an overall
      growth trend with characteristics of the times. The RCTs of manual acupuncture
      ranked the top, and its proportion of publications every 5 years was stable in
      the past 30 years. Since 1994, the hot words such as electroacupuncture, warming 
      needling, auricular point sticking and various acupoint therapies had emerged;
      meanwhile, the spectrum of diseases had broadened, and an evolutionary trend
      corresponding to therapies and disease systems had been formed. In recent decade,
      the RCTs using moxibustion therapy have increased significantly, and the hot
      words such as "sub-health" "winter diseases being treated in summer" and
      "acupoint application/ moxibustion during the dog days" had indicated that
      acupuncture clinical research was further inclined to the field of chronic
      disease prevention and health services, which was in line with social development
      and the needs of the times.

      varicoceles.
PG  - 339-344
LID - 10.4103/iju.iju_201_21 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: YouTube has grown into one of the largest disseminators of health
      care information. We assessed the quality of information on varicoceles and their
      treatment, available on YouTube. Methods: Using a YouTube search query with the
      keyword "varicocele," the quality of the first 50, nonrepeat videos in English
      were assessed as a representative group for the topic. DISCERN and Patient
      Education Materials Assessment Tool for Audiovisual Materials (PEMAT-AV)
      standardized tools were utilized by three independent reviewers to grade the
      quality of these videos based on content, understandability, and actionability.
      Results: The average and median DISCERN score was 31.34 (+/-9.37) and 31
      (interquartile range 25-35), respectively, indicating poor quality. The
      interrater reliability (IRR) scores ranged from 0.51 to 0.93, indicating fair to 
      excellent reliability. The average PEMAT-AV understandability and actionability
      scores were 69.8% +/-15.4% and 11.0% +/-24.6%, respectively, indicating mostly
      understandable but poor actionability. The t-test results showed that
      international videos scored higher without statistical significance in the
      DISCERN or PEMAT-AV scores (P = 0.18, 0.59, and 0.20). Conclusions: The current
      quality of videos on YouTube on the topic of varicoceles is of poor quality due
      to a lack of a holistic approach in explaining the wide range of treatment
      options available. With the ease of access to produce and disseminate health
      information, there is a need to create high-quality videos on varicoceles that
      empower a patient to make an informed decision.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the content, reliability and quality of information
      regarding vesicoureteral reflux in YouTube videos, as a source of patient
      information. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, a YouTube
      search with the keyword "vesicoureteral reflux" was performed on April 15, 2021, 
      and the first 150 videos were listed according to relevancy. Advertisements,
      duplicate videos, videos in languages other than English, and videos without
      audio were excluded. Video features (time since upload, run time, number of like,
      dislike, views and comments) and source of upload were recorded. The quality,
      reliability and accuracy of the information were evaluated independently by an
      urologist and a pediatrician using the Journal of American Medical Association
      (JAMA) score, the 5-point modified DISCERN tool and the Global Quality Score
      (GQS). Video quality was assessed according to the source of upload and video
      features. The correlation analysis was performed between video features, GQS,
      JAMA and DISCERN scores. RESULTS: A total number of 125 videos were analyzed. The
      most common source of upload was hospital, clinician, practice (43.2%) and the
      majority of the content (25.6%) was about symptoms and diagnosis options. The
      median JAMA score, modified DISCERN score and GQS was 3 (1-4) (1-5) (1-5),
      respectively. JAMA scores were significantly higher in videos that were uploaded 
      by hospital, clinician, practice (except tv programs). Modified DISCERN scores
      and GQS scores of videos uploaded by hospital, clinician, practice was
      significantly higher than Industry, advertisements, for profit-organizations and 
      individual users, patients (see Summary Table). There is a positive correlation
      between the number of likes and VPI as well as JAMA, DISCERN, and GQS scores.
      CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant amount of VUR-related content on YouTube and 
      the source of the video influences on quality. Almost half of the videos have
      poor quality, and people apparently choose videos that are technically better,
      and "technical" videos over "experiential" ones.

TI  - Manganese Toxicity Associated With Total Parenteral Nutrition: A Review.
PG  - 260-266
LID - 10.1177/87551225211023686 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To review hypermanganesemia-induced toxicities in adult patients
      receiving parenteral nutrition (PN) therapy. Data Sources: A comprehensive
      literature review was conducted from June 2020 to May 2021 on PubMED, MEDLINE,
      Scopus, ProQuest, the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature
      (CINAHL), and Web of Science. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Keyword and
      Boolean phrase searches were conducted using the following terminology:
      "manganese" OR "manganesemia" OR "manganism" or "hypermanganesemia" AND "total
      parenteral nutrition" OR "PN" or "parenteral nutrition" AND "toxicity" OR
      "accumulation." Appropriate filters, including "humans" and "English" and NOT
      "reviews," were utilized on all databases to improve search outcomes. Data
      Synthesis: A total of 4 reports detailing hypermanganesemia in 57 patient
      encounters were included in this review. Significant heterogeneity exists with
      regard to the duration of manganese supplementation and the dose of manganese.
      Toxicity associated with manganese was observed in as few as 15 days. The dose of
      manganese, though likely governed by content in commercially available products, 
      may regularly exceed the recommendations of clinical guidelines and should be
      limited to 55 microg/day. Select patients with underlying malignancy, those with 
      significant and prolonged Vitamin D deficiency, or those who have acquired a
      SLC30A10 genetic mutation may be at an increased risk of developing manganese
      toxicity. Conclusions: Clinicians must be cognizant of the concentration of trace
      elements added to PN, as manganese, and perhaps other biometals, may accumulate
      when dosed above the recommended daily allowances.

PG  - 202-208
LID - 10.1177/87551225211004145 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To determine the efficacy and safety of second-generation
      antipsychotics (SGAs) as adjunctive analgesics. Data Sources: A comprehensive
      literature review was conducted between August 2020 and January 2021 on PubMed,
      Scopus, and ProQuest Central. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Keyword and
      Boolean phrase searches using the following terminology were conducted:
      "Quetiapine" OR "Risperidone" OR "Olanzapine" OR "Ziprasidone" AND "Analgesia"
      NOT "Psychosis" NOT "Psych." Articles that involved human adult patients who
      received any of the SGAs mentioned in the searching filter with an opioid were
      included. Articles that described pediatrics, pregnant women, patients who
      received any of these agents for treatment of psychosis and articles that were
      not in English, or readily translatable to English, were excluded. Data
      Synthesis: Three articles were selected for inclusion in this review, with 2
      articles detailing reports with olanzapine and 1 article describing a randomized,
      controlled trial with extended-release quetiapine. Both olanzapine and quetiapine
      were able to decrease pain scores on the numeric rating scale, indicating a
      reduction pain experienced, and additionally reduced opioid craving behavior in
      patients. Depression scores and quality-of-life indicators improved with
      quetiapine, though those metrics were not studied with olanzapine. Conclusions:
      Select SGAs, specifically extended-release quetiapine and olanzapine, may serve
      as an appropriate adjunctive analgesic choice in select patients. Further
      research is required in a clinical setting to determine the exact role of this
      drug class in pain management.

      Review of the Literature.
PG  - 107-113
LID - 10.1177/8755122520962859 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To determine the most appropriate thiamine replacement regimen by
      evaluating safety and efficacy of the drug specific to alcohol-induced Wernicke's
      encephalopathy (WE). Data Sources: A comprehensive literature search was
      conducted using PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, and ProQuest between January and August 
      2020 using the following keyword and Boolean search terminology: "thiamine" AND
      "alcohol" AND (encephalopathy OR korsakoff). Study Selection and Data Extraction:
      Randomized control trials; prospective, observational, and retrospective cohort
      analyses; and case reports and series were included in this evaluation. A
      confirmed diagnosis of alcohol-induced WE and treatment with parenteral or
      intramuscular (IM) thiamine were required for inclusion. Data Synthesis: Six
      publications composed of 138 patients were evaluated in this review, in which a
      wide variety of thiamine supplementation strategies were employed. Clinical
      diagnostic criteria varied significantly between publications. Doses ranged from 
      100 to 1500 mg intravenous thiamine and up to 300 mg IM thiamine, with no
      apparent difference in patient outcomes. All patients who received thiamine
      experienced symptom improvement, and adverse drug events were minimal.
      Conclusions: Despite the clinical controversy regarding the appropriate thiamine 
      supplementation regimen, the heterogeneity of published works combined with
      symptom resolution across the gamut of dosing strategies makes a definitive
      consensus elusive. Clinicians should continue to provide parenteral or IM
      thiamine in doses of >/=100 mg to patients with confirmed alcohol-induced WE.

      long-standing persistent AF. However, data on the AE related to the EPi-Sense
      device are scarce. METHODS: Keyword "EPI-SENSE" was searched on the MAUDE
      database. There were 80 device reports from 2016 to 2020. After excluding reports
      when the device was not returned for evaluation, 79 device reports were included 
      for final analysis. RESULTS: The adverse events (AE) were broadly classified into
      11 categories. The most common complications were pericardial effusion (25.3%),
      stroke (17.7%), and atrioesophageal fistula (AEF) (8.9%). Death was reported in
      15 (19%) cases, 3 of which were due to pulmonary embolism, 6 due to AEF, 3 due to
      unknown cause, 1 due to sepsis, 2 due to events related to acute renal failure.
      DISCUSSION: Pericardial effusion is a common AE reported in patients with
      convergence procedures and is well documented in the CONVERGE trial. The
      convergent procedure is unique in that the epicardial ablations are performed on 
      the posterior wall with the radiofrequency probe directed towards the heart and
      away from the esophagus which in theory should reduce esophageal injuries.
      Despite that, a high number of AEF were noticed. Finally, there were also some
      reports of saline perfusion malfunction which can lead to injuries due to
      overheating. CONCLUSION: This analysis of the AE related to the EPi-Sense device 
      highlights several major AE that are previously unreported.

TI  - Patient-specific Implants for Orbital Fractures: A Systematic Review.
LID - 10.1097/IOP.0000000000002089 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Orbital fractures are common facial fractures that can be challenging to
      repair and require careful attention to avoid unacceptable ophthalmic
      complications. Customized implants that are unique to an individual patient, or
      patient-specific implants (PSIs), have been increasingly used to repair orbital
      wall fractures. This systematic review summarizes the current evidence regarding 
      custom-made orbital wall implants. METHODS: A keyword search of published
      literature from January 2010 to September 2021 was performed using Ovid MEDLINE, 
      PubMed, and the Cochrane Library databases. Original articles that included more 
      than 3 human subjects with an orbital fracture repaired with a PSI were included.
      The search results were reviewed, duplicates were removed and relevant articles
      were included for analysis. RESULTS: Fifteen articles meeting the inclusion
      criteria. The articles were categorized into 3 separate groups based on the
      method of PSI fabrication: manual molding of a PSI on a 3D-printed orbital model 
      (53%), directly from a 3D printer (27%), or via a template fabricated from a 3D
      printer (20%). Three primary postoperative outcomes were assessed: rates of
      diplopia, enophthalmos, and orbital volume. Postoperative rates of diplopia and
      enophthalmos improved regardless of the PSI technique, and postoperative orbital 
      volumes were reduced compared with their preoperative state. When PSIs were
      compared to conventional implants, patient outcomes were comparable. CONCLUSIONS:
      This review of existing PSI orbital implant literature highlights that while PSI 
      can accurately and safely repair orbital fractures, patient outcomes are largely 
      comparable to orbital fractures repaired by conventional methods, and PSI do not 
      offer a definitive benefit over conventional implants.

TI  - OpenSAFELY NHS Service Restoration Observatory 1: primary care clinical activity 
      in England during the first wave of COVID-19.
PG  - e63-e74
LID - 10.3399/BJGP.2021.0380 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted healthcare activity. The NHS
      stopped non-urgent work in March 2020, later recommending services be restored to
      near-normal levels before winter where possible. AIM: To describe the volume and 
      variation of coded clinical activity in general practice, taking respiratory
      disease and laboratory procedures as examples. DESIGN AND SETTING: Working on
      behalf of NHS England, a cohort study was conducted of 23.8 million patient
      records in general practice, in situ using OpenSAFELY. METHOD: Activity using
      Clinical Terms Version 3 codes and keyword searches from January 2019 to
      September 2020 are described. RESULTS: Activity recorded in general practice
      declined during the pandemic, but largely recovered by September. There was a
      large drop in coded activity for laboratory tests, with broad recovery to
      pre-pandemic levels by September. One exception was the international normalised 
      ratio test, with a smaller reduction (median tests per 1000 patients in 2020:
      February 8.0; April 6.2; September 6.9). The pattern of recording for respiratory
      symptoms was less affected, following an expected seasonal pattern and classified
      as 'no change'. Respiratory infections exhibited a sustained drop, not returning 
      to pre-pandemic levels by September. Asthma reviews experienced a small drop but 
      recovered, whereas chronic obstructive pulmonary disease reviews remained below
      baseline. CONCLUSION: An open-source software framework was delivered to describe
      trends and variation in clinical activity across an unprecedented scale of
      primary care data. The COVD-19 pandemic led to a substantial change in healthcare
      activity. Most laboratory tests showed substantial reduction, largely recovering 
      to near-normal levels by September, with some important tests less affected and
      recording of respiratory disease codes was mixed.

TI  - Are some feasibility studies more feasible than others? A review of the outcomes 
      of feasibility studies on the ISRCTN registry.
PG  - 195
LID - 10.1186/s40814-021-00931-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Feasibility studies are often conducted before committing to a
      randomised controlled trial (RCT), yet there is little published evidence to
      inform how useful feasibility studies are, especially in terms of adding or
      reducing waste in research. This study attempted to examine how many feasibility 
      studies demonstrated that the full trial was feasible and whether some
      feasibility studies were inherently likely to be feasible or not feasible, based 
      on the topic area and/or research setting. METHODS: Keyword searches were
      conducted on the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trials Number
      (ISRCTN) registry to identify all completed feasibility studies which had been
      conducted in the UK. RESULTS: A total of 625 records from the 1933 identified
      were reviewed before it became evident that it would be futile to continue. Of
      329 feasibility studies identified, 160 had a known outcome (49%), 133 (83%)
      trials were deemed to be feasible and only 27 (17%) were reported to be
      non-feasible. There were therefore too few studies to allow the intended
      comparison of differences in non-feasible studies by topic and/or setting.
      CONCLUSIONS: There were too few studies reported as non-feasible to draw any
      useful conclusions on whether topic and/or setting had an effect. However, the
      high feasibility rate (83%) may suggest that non-feasible studies are subject to 
      publication bias or that many feasible studies are redundant and may be adding
      waste to the research pathway.

LID - 10.1080/17538157.2021.1990934 [doi]
AB  - To evaluate the fibromyalgia (FM) content in YouTube videos and verify if
      American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines are being met. The videos were 
      searched with the keyword "Fibromyalgia." Two independent researchers evaluated
      and coded specific characteristics of the videos. The popularity of the videos,
      the presentation properties, and content related to FM according to the ACR
      criteria were analyzed. Of the 200 videos included, the majority were presented
      by health professionals, 61.5%. Most videos covered more than one subject, 38.5%.
      The videos presented by health professionals were the most viewed. Following the 
      ACR guidelines, 38% defined FM, 24% described the etiology, 19.5% described the
      diagnostic criteria and 52% presented recommended management strategies. The
      results indicate that users mainly watch videos published by health
      professionals. Most of the published videos do not follow the information
      recommended by the ACR guidelines. Therefore, videos should be interpreted with
      caution, not being the most appropriate resource for health education for
      patients with FM. Most of the videos published on YouTube about FM do not meet
      the ACR guidelines for FM.

TI  - IgG4-Related Disease in Intradural Extramedullary Location- Detailed Case
      Illustration and Literature Review with Special Emphasis on Role of Surgery in
      its Management.
PG  - 1176-1183
LID - 10.4103/0028-3886.329549 [doi]
AB  - Background: IgG4-related disease (IgG4RD) is a multisystemic progressive
      fibroinflammatory and lymphoproliferative autoimmune disorder of unknown
      etiopathogenesis; and its occurrence in intradural extramedullary (IDEM) location
      is extremely rare. Aim and Objective: The aim of this study was to review all
      IDEM IgG4RD cases described in English literature and to signify the role of
      surgery in its management at this rare location along with the surgical technique
      and intraoperative findings. Methods: An Internet-based search (PubMed) for the
      published reports describing spinal cases of IgG4RD with IDEM involvement was
      done using the keyword: spinal IgG4-related disease. An illustration of a case of
      cranial IgG4-related disease in a young man who developed metachronous cervical
      involvement in intradural extramedullary (IDEM) location is also presented.
      Results: Amongst 45 spinal IgG4RD cases reported in English Literature, only 3
      cases were IDEM IgG4RD. In the illustrated case, portion of the cervical lesion
      causing cervical cord encasement was intradural but extraarachnoidal- located
      between arachnoid and dura, without any pial involvement. All these 4 cases
      improved following surgery. Conclusion: Timely meticulous resection of mass
      lesion in situations of medical treatment failure or progressive neurological
      decline can lead to reversibility of mass effect-associated neurological
      manifestations of IgG4RD.

TI  - Health Information Needs of Young Chinese People Based on an Online Health
      Community: Topic and Statistical Analysis.
PG  - e30356
LID - 10.2196/30356 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The internet has been widely accessible and well accepted by young
      people; however, there is a limited understanding of the internet usage patterns 
      and characteristics on issues related to health problems. The contents posted on 
      online health communities (OHCs) are valuable resources to learn about youth's
      health information needs. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we concurrently exploited
      statistical analysis and topic analysis of online health information needs to
      explore the distribution, impact factors, and topics of interest relevant to
      Chinese young people. METHODS: We collected 60,478 health-related data sets
      posted by young people from a well-known Chinese OHC named xywy.com. Descriptive 
      statistical analysis and correlation analysis were applied to find the
      distribution and influence factors of the information needs of Chinese young
      people. Furthermore, a general 4-step topic mining strategy was presented for
      sparse short texts, which included sentence vectorization, dimension reduction,
      clustering, and keyword generation. RESULTS: In the Chinese OHC, Chinese young
      people had a high demand for information in the areas of gynecology and
      obstetrics, internal medicine, dermatology, plastic surgery, and surgery, and
      they focused on topics such as treatment, symptoms, causes, pathology, and diet. 
      Females accounted for 69.67% (42,136/60,478) and young adults accounted for
      87.44% (52,882/60,478) of all data. Gender, age, and disease type all had a
      significant effect on young people's information needs and topic preferences
      (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: We conducted comprehensive analyses to discover the online
      health information needs of Chinese young people. The research findings are of
      great practical value to carry out health education and health knowledge
      dissemination inside and outside of schools according to the interests of youth, 
      enable the innovation of information services in OHCs, and improve the health
      literacy of young people.

TI  - YouTube videos in Japanese as a source of information on nocturnal enuresis: a
      content-quality and reliability analysis.
LID - 10.1111/ped.15049 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the quality and reliability of Japanese 
      YouTube videos pertaining to nocturnal enuresis (NE). METHODS: In this
      cross-sectional study, we performed a YouTube search using the keyword
      "Ya-nyou-shou" (NE in Japanese). We considered the first 200 videos listed based 
      on the YouTube default option. Videos that were irrelevant, concerned personal
      experiences or adult NE, had non-Japanese content, were advertisements, were
      duplicated, and those without audio were excluded. Video features and upload
      source were recorded. The Modified DISCERN, Journal of the American Medical
      Association (JAMA), and Global Quality Scale (GQS) scoring systems were used for 
      analysis. Two independent pediatricians specialized in nephrology and urology
      completed the scoring. Correlation analysis was performed between video features 
      and the three quality analysis scores. RESULTS: In total, 72 videos were
      analyzed. The most common upload sources were physicians (40.3%) and
      non-physician health personnel (40.3%). The median modified DISCERN, JAMA, and
      GQS scores for the videos were 1 (lowest: 0; highest: 4), 2 (lowest: 1; highest: 
      3), and 2 (lowest: 1; highest: 4), respectively. The high scores for video power 
      index (VPI) were for independent users (6.43 points) and physicians (3.05
      points). There were positive correlations between the VPI and video length and
      modified DISCERN and GQS scores. No video presenters disclosed conflicts of
      interest. CONCLUSIONS: Most Japanese YouTube videos about NE were low quality.
      Healthcare experts should be encouraged to upload more quality content.

TI  - Management and Plan of Undergraduates' Mental Health Based on Keyword Extraction.
PG  - 3361755
LID - 10.1155/2021/3361755 [doi]
AB  - Mental health issues are alarmingly on the rise among undergraduates, which have 
      gradually become the focus of social attention. With the emergence of some
      abnormal events such as more and more undergraduates' suspension, and even
      suicide due to mental health issues, the social attention to undergraduates'
      mental health has reached a climax. According to the questionnaire of
      undergraduates' mental health issues, this paper uses keyword extraction to
      analyze the management and plan of undergraduates' mental health. Based on the
      classical TextRank algorithm, this paper proposes an improved TextRank algorithm 
      based on upper approximation rough data-deduction. The experimental results show 
      that the accurate rate, recall rate, and F1 of proposed algorithm have been
      significantly improved, and the experimental results also demonstrate that the
      proposed algorithm has good performance in running time and physical memory
      occupation.

TI  - Research Trends and Collaboration Patterns on Polymyxin Resistance: A
      Bibliometric Analysis (2010-2019).
PG  - 702937
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2021.702937 [doi]
AB  - Background: Antimicrobial resistance is a serious public health problem that has 
      become a global threat. Special attention should be given to polymyxins
      (polymyxin B and colistin) which, since their reintroduction into clinical
      practice, are considered "last resort" drugs. The objective of this study is to
      perform a bibliometric analysis of scientific research on polymyxin resistance.
      Methods: Scopus was used to retrieve documents relevant to polymyxin resistance
      from 2010 to 2019. Data was exported to Microsoft Excel for table presentation.
      SciVal was used for volume and citation analysis as well as collaboration
      patterns. Also, we extracted data regarding the top documents, authors,
      countries, institutions, and the metrics of journals. VantagePoint and VOSviewer 
      were used for geographical distribution of worldwide research and keyword
      co-occurrence analysis, respectively. Results: A total of 1,409 documents were
      retrieved. The retrieved documents received 25.0 citations per document. Articles
      (73.88%) and letters (18.09%) were the most frequent types of documents. During
      2010-2019, there was a significant growth in publications (p-value < 0.001). The 
      received citations were 35,209 with a peak in 2016 (11,250 citations). China and 
      the United States led the scientific production with 299 (21.2%) and 238 (16.9%) 
      publications, respectively. Little or no contribution came from central Asia,
      Sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America. Chinese institutions have caused the
      greatest impact, with University of Zhejiang (China) being the most prolific
      institution on the subject (88 documents). In terms of the most productive
      journals, Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy ranked first with 196 (13.9%)
      documents. Most of the documents were published in quartile one journals and only
      had national collaboration (43.2%). Analysis of keyword co-occurrence revealed
      that research on polymyxin resistance during the last decade has focused on its
      relationship with public health, pharmacology, and genetics. Conclusion: The
      number of documents on polymyxin resistance has increased significantly in the
      recent years, with a steep growth from 2016 onwards. China and the United States 
      led the scientific production. Most of the documents were published in
      high-quality journals. Greater joint efforts and more contribution from central
      Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America are still needed to tackle this
      global problem.

TI  - Analysis of mental and physical disorders associated with COVID-19 in online
      health forums: a natural language processing study.
PG  - e056601
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2021-056601 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Online health forums provide rich and untapped real-time data on
      population health. Through novel data extraction and natural language processing 
      (NLP) techniques, we characterise the evolution of mental and physical health
      concerns relating to the COVID-19 pandemic among online health forum users.
      SETTING AND DESIGN: We obtained data from three leading online health forums:
      HealthBoards, Inspire and HealthUnlocked, from the period 1 January 2020 to 31
      May 2020. Using NLP, we analysed the content of posts related to COVID-19.
      PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) Proportion of forum posts containing COVID-19
      keywords; (2) proportion of forum users making their very first post about
      COVID-19; (3) proportion of COVID-19-related posts containing content related to 
      physical and mental health comorbidities. RESULTS: Data from 739 434 posts
      created by 53 134 unique users were analysed. A total of 35 581 posts (4.8%)
      contained a COVID-19 keyword. Posts discussing COVID-19 and related comorbid
      disorders spiked in early March to mid-March around the time of global
      implementation of lockdowns prompting a large number of users to post on online
      health forums for the first time. Over a quarter of COVID-19-related thread
      titles mentioned a physical or mental health comorbidity. CONCLUSIONS: We
      demonstrate that it is feasible to characterise the content of online health
      forum user posts regarding COVID-19 and measure changes over time. The pandemic
      and corresponding public response has had a significant impact on posters'
      queries regarding mental health. Social media data sources such as online health 
      forums can be harnessed to strengthen population-level mental health
      surveillance.

TI  - EntropyHub: An open-source toolkit for entropic time series analysis.
PG  - e0259448
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0259448 [doi]
AB  - An increasing number of studies across many research fields from biomedical
      engineering to finance are employing measures of entropy to quantify the
      regularity, variability or randomness of time series and image data. Entropy, as 
      it relates to information theory and dynamical systems theory, can be estimated
      in many ways, with newly developed methods being continuously introduced in the
      scientific literature. Despite the growing interest in entropic time series and
      image analysis, there is a shortage of validated, open-source software tools that
      enable researchers to apply these methods. To date, packages for performing
      entropy analysis are often run using graphical user interfaces, lack the
      necessary supporting documentation, or do not include functions for more advanced
      entropy methods, such as cross-entropy, multiscale cross-entropy or bidimensional
      entropy. In light of this, this paper introduces EntropyHub, an open-source
      toolkit for performing entropic time series analysis in MATLAB, Python and Julia.
      EntropyHub (version 0.1) provides an extensive range of more than forty functions
      for estimating cross-, multiscale, multiscale cross-, and bidimensional entropy, 
      each including a number of keyword arguments that allows the user to specify
      multiple parameters in the entropy calculation. Instructions for installation,
      descriptions of function syntax, and examples of use are fully detailed in the
      supporting documentation, available on the EntropyHub website-
      www.EntropyHub.xyz. Compatible with Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems,
      EntropyHub is hosted on GitHub, as well as the native package repository for
      MATLAB, Python and Julia, respectively. The goal of EntropyHub is to integrate
      the many established entropy methods into one complete resource, providing tools 
      that make advanced entropic time series analysis straightforward and
      reproducible.

TI  - The Upper Paralimbal Zone is Especially Susceptible to Ruptures Due to Blunt
      Trauma.
LID - 10.1055/a-1521-5124 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Globe ruptures are ophthalmological emergencies where the primary
      diagnosis using a slit lamp is often a challenge. OBJECTIVES: The retrospective
      case study aimed to characterise the predilection sites, the demographic profile 
      and the causes of bursts due to blunt globe trauma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The
      surgical plan of the Eye Centre of the Medical Centre (University of Freiburg)
      was electronically searched using the keyword "globe rupture" over a period of 18
      years (2000 - 2018). This led to 350 hits, which were scrutinised by hand. 134
      globe ruptures due to blunt globe trauma were then identified. RESULTS: The most 
      common predilection sites were the upper nasal and the upper temporal paralimbal 
      zones with 37 and 32% of the examined globe ruptures, respectively. The average
      age at the time of rupture was 60 (from 2 to 97) years. The median age was 62.5
      years. 37% (49/134) of patients were female. The most frequent causes of
      accidents were falls (43%), "flying" wooden and metal objects (18%) and acts of
      violence (10%). CONCLUSIONS: Special attention should be paid to the upper
      paralimbal zone in the exploratory primary care of globe ruptures. If the rupture
      occurred due to "flying" wooden and metal objects, the posterior sclera burst
      most frequently. The epidemiological data suggest that targeted prevention
      against falls for individuals over 60 years and consistent wearing of protective 
      eyewear when working with wood or metal could reduce the incidence of bulbar
      bursting. It was also noticeable that acts of violence were the third most
      frequent cause of rupture, although woman did not report that they were affected 
      by this. Given the high occurrence of violence against women, shame and stigma
      may lead to an incorrect inquiry about the cause of the accident. This could be
      mitigated by training employees specifically to take a sensitive history.

TI  - The Economic Burden of Lupus Nephritis: A Systematic Literature Review.
PG  - 25-47
LID - 10.1007/s40744-021-00368-y [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Few studies have evaluated the economic burden of lupus nephritis
      (LN). The aim of this systematic literature review (SLR) was to assess the
      economic burden (direct and indirect costs, and healthcare resource utilization
      [HCRU]) associated with LN, with particular focus on the burden of renal flares
      and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). METHODS: This SLR (GSK study 213531) was
      conducted and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
      Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Searches of the MEDLINE and Embase
      databases were conducted for English language publications reporting cost or HCRU
      data in patients with LN (regardless of age or LN histological class) until
      December 10, 2019. Handsearching of conference proceedings and keyword-based
      searches in PubMed, Google, and Google Scholar were also conducted. RESULTS:
      Twenty-two studies were identified from 28 publications reporting the cost (n =
      19) and HCRU (n = 13) associated with LN. Most studies were from North America (n
      = 13) and many used administrative claims data (n = 9). LN was associated with
      substantially higher direct costs (e.g., total annual, hospitalization, and
      ESKD-related direct costs), total indirect costs, and HCRU (e.g.,
      hospitalization, outpatient services, and medication use) compared with patients 
      without systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or non-renal SLE controls. ESKD and
      dialysis were significant contributors to economic burden. No studies described
      the cost of renal flares. CONCLUSIONS: The consensus across the 22 studies was
      that the economic burden of LN is substantial, particularly in active or severe
      disease, or if there is progression to ESKD. Total direct cost may be
      underestimated in claims data given the challenges of identifying patients with
      LN. Further studies are vital to ascertain the cost of renal flares; a renal
      flare is likely to result in a period of increased HCRU, which could be mitigated
      by treatments that extend renal remission.

TI  - A Mixed-Methods Comparison of a National and State Opioid Overdose Surveillance
      Definition.
PG  - 31S-39S
LID - 10.1177/00333549211018181 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We assessed the differences between the first version of the Centers 
      for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) opioid surveillance definition for
      suspected nonfatal opioid overdoses (hereinafter, CDC definition) and the North
      Carolina Disease Event Tracking and Epidemiologic Collection Tool (NC DETECT)
      surveillance definition to determine whether the North Carolina definition should
      include additional International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision,
      Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes and/or chief complaint keywords. METHODS:
      Two independent reviewers retrospectively reviewed data on North Carolina
      emergency department (ED) visits generated by components of the CDC definition
      not included in the NC DETECT definition from January 1 through July 31, 2018.
      Clinical reviewers identified false positives as any ED visit in which available 
      evidence supported an alternative explanation for patient presentation deemed
      more likely than an opioid overdose. After individual assessment, reviewers
      reconciled disagreements. RESULTS: We identified 2296 ED visits under the CDC
      definition that were not identified under the NC DETECT definition during the
      study period. False-positive rates ranged from 2.6% to 41.4% for codes and
      keywords uniquely identifying >/=10 ED visits. Based on uniquely identifying
      >/=10 ED visits and a false-positive rate </=10.0%, 4 of 16 ICD-10-CM codes
      evaluated were identified for NC DETECT definition inclusion. Only 2 of 25
      keywords evaluated, "OD" and "overdose," met inclusion criteria to be considered 
      a meaningful addition to the NC DETECT definition. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS:
      Quantitative and qualitative trends in coding and keyword use identified in this 
      analysis may prove helpful for future evaluations of surveillance definitions.

TI  - Using Emergency Medical Services Data to Monitor Nonfatal Opioid Overdoses in
      Real Time : Development, Validation, and Use of a Case Definition, Rhode Island, 
      2018.
PG  - 40S-46S
LID - 10.1177/00333549211018989 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: No case definition exists that allows public health authorities to
      accurately identify opioid overdoses using emergency medical services (EMS) data.
      We developed and evaluated a case definition for suspected nonfatal opioid
      overdoses in EMS data. METHODS: To identify suspected opioid overdose-related EMS
      runs, in 2019 the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) developed a case
      definition using the primary impression, secondary impression, selection of
      naloxone in the dropdown field for medication given, indication of medication
      response in a dropdown field, and keyword search of the report narrative. We
      developed the case definition with input from EMS personnel and validated it
      using an iterative process of random medical record review. We used naloxone
      administration in consideration with other factors to avoid misclassification of 
      opioid overdoses. RESULTS: In 2018, naloxone was administered during 2513 EMS
      runs in Rhode Island, of which 1501 met our case definition of a nonfatal opioid 
      overdose. Based on a review of 400 randomly selected EMS runs in which naloxone
      was administered, the RIDOH case definition accurately identified 90.0% of opioid
      overdoses and accurately excluded 83.3% of non-opioid overdose-related EMS runs. 
      Use of the case definition enabled analyses that identified key patterns in
      overdose locations, people who experienced repeat overdoses, and the creation of 
      hotspot maps to inform outbreak detection and response. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS:
      EMS data can be an effective tool for monitoring overdoses in real time and
      informing public health practice. To accurately identify opioid overdose-related 
      EMS runs, the use of a comprehensive case definition is essential.

      especially transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), has increasingly been 
      used to modulate brain function in various physiological and pathological
      conditions. However, its experimental applications for people with MS were noted 
      only as recently as 2010 and have been growing since then. The efficacy for use
      in people with MS remains questionable with the results of existing studies being
      largely conflicting. Hence, the aim of this review is to paint a picture of the
      current state of tDCS in MS research grounded on studies applying tDCS that have 
      been done to date. METHODS: A keyword search was performed to retrieve articles
      from the earliest article identified until 14 February 2021 using a combination
      of the groups (1) 'multiple sclerosis', 'MS' and 'encephalomyelitis' and (2)
      'tDCS' and 'transcranial direct current stimulation'. RESULTS: The analysis of
      the 30 articles included in this review underlined inconsistent effects of tDCS
      on the motor symptoms of MS based on small sample sizes. However, tDCS showed
      promising benefits in ameliorating fatigue, pain and cognitive symptoms.
      CONCLUSION: Transcranial direct current stimulation is attractive as a non-drug
      approach in ameliorating MS symptoms, where other treatment options remain
      limited. The development of protocols tailored to the individual's own
      neuroanatomy using high definition tDCS and the introduction of network mapping
      in the experimental designs might help to overcome the variability between
      studies.

TI  - Anesthesia and World War II: When the Battlefield Becomes a Research Field-A
      Bibliometric Analysis of the Influence of World War II on the Development of
      Anesthesiology.
PG  - 216-224
LID - 10.1213/ANE.0000000000005745 [doi]
AB  - At the outbreak of World War II (WWII), anesthesiology was struggling to
      establish itself as a medical specialty. The battlefield abruptly exposed this
      young specialty to the formidable challenge of mass casualties, with an urgent
      need to provide proper fluid resuscitation, airway management, mechanical
      ventilation, and analgesia to thousands. But while Europe was suffering under the
      Nazi boot, anesthesia was preparing to rise to the challenge posed by the
      impending war. While war brings death and destruction, it also opens the way to
      medical advances. The aim of this study is to measure the evolution of anesthesia
      owing to WWII. We conducted a retrospective observational bibliometric study
      involving a quantitative and statistical analysis of publications. The following 
      7 journals were selected to cover European and North American anesthesia-related 
      publications: Anesthesia & Analgesia, the British Journal of Anaesthesia,
      Anesthesiology, Schmerz-Narkose-Anaesthesie, Surgery, La Presse Medicale, and The
      Military Surgeon (later Military Medicine). Attention was focused on journal
      volumes published between 1920 and 1965. After reviewing the literature, we
      selected 12 keywords representing important advances in anesthesiology since
      1920: "anesthesia," "balanced anesthesia," "barbiturates," "d-tubocurarine,"
      "endotracheal intubation," "ether," "lidocaine," "morphine," "spinal anesthesia,"
      "thiopental," "transfusion," and "trichloroethylene." Titles of original articles
      from all selected journals editions between 1920 and 1965 were screened for the
      occurrence of 1 of the 12 keywords. A total of 26,132 original article titles
      were screened for the occurrence of the keywords. A total of 1815 keywords were
      found. Whereas Anesthesia & Analgesia had the highest keyword occurrence (493
      citations), Schmerz-Narkose-Anaesthesie had the lowest (38 citations). The number
      of publications of the 12 keywords was significantly higher in the postwar than
      in the prewar period (65% and 35%, respectively; P < .001). Not surprisingly, the
      anesthesiology journals have a higher occurrence of keywords than those journals 
      covering other specialties. The overall occurrence of keywords also showed peaks 
      during other major conflicts, namely the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), the
      Korean War (1950-1953), and the Vietnam War (1955-1975). For the first time, this
      study demonstrates statistically the impact of WWII on the progress of
      anesthesiology. It also offers an objective record of the chronology of the major
      advances in anesthesiology before and after the conflict. While the war arguably 
      helped to enhance anesthesiology as a specialty, in return anesthesiology helped 
      to heal the wounds of war.

TI  - Visualizing Knowledge Evolution Trends and Research Hotspots of Personal Health
      Data Research: Bibliometric Analysis.
PG  - e31142
LID - 10.2196/31142 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The recent surge in clinical and nonclinical health-related data has 
      been accompanied by a concomitant increase in personal health data (PHD) research
      across multiple disciplines such as medicine, computer science, and management.
      There is now a need to synthesize the dynamic knowledge of PHD in various
      disciplines to spot potential research hotspots. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study
      was to reveal the knowledge evolutionary trends in PHD and detect potential
      research hotspots using bibliometric analysis. METHODS: We collected 8281
      articles published between 2009 and 2018 from the Web of Science database. The
      knowledge evolution analysis (KEA) framework was used to analyze the evolution of
      PHD research. The KEA framework is a bibliometric approach that is based on 3
      knowledge networks: reference co-citation, keyword co-occurrence, and discipline 
      co-occurrence. RESULTS: The findings show that the focus of PHD research has
      evolved from medicine centric to technology centric to human centric since 2009. 
      The most active PHD knowledge cluster is developing knowledge resources and
      allocating scarce resources. The field of computer science, especially the topic 
      of artificial intelligence (AI), has been the focal point of recent empirical
      studies on PHD. Topics related to psychology and human factors (eg, attitude,
      satisfaction, education) are also receiving more attention. CONCLUSIONS: Our
      analysis shows that PHD research has the potential to provide value-based health 
      care in the future. All stakeholders should be educated about AI technology to
      promote value generation through PHD. Moreover, technology developers and health 
      care institutions should consider human factors to facilitate the effective
      adoption of PHD-related technology. These findings indicate opportunities for
      interdisciplinary cooperation in several PHD research areas: (1) AI applications 
      for PHD; (2) regulatory issues and governance of PHD; (3) education of all
      stakeholders about AI technology; and (4) value-based health care including
      "allocative value," "technology value," and "personalized value."

      Analysis.
PG  - 721872
LID - 10.3389/fpsyg.2021.721872 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: The purpose of this study was to explore the current status and
      trends of acupuncture for depression in the last decade and provide new insights 
      for researchers in future studies. Methods: The articles regarding acupuncture
      treatment for depression published between 2011 and 2020 were extracted from the 
      Web of Science Core Collection. We used CiteSpace to analyze data on
      publications, countries, institutions, cited journals, cited authors, cited
      references, keywords, and citation bursts about acupuncture and depression.
      Results: A total of 1,032 publications were obtained from 2011 to 2020. We
      identified the most prolific journals, countries, institutions, and authors in
      the field of acupuncture for depression in the last decade. The most prolific
      country and institutions were the People's Republic of China and KyungHee
      University, respectively. Evidence-based Complementary and Alternative Medicine
      was the most prolific and cited journal. The author with the highest centrality
      was Zhangjin Zhang, and the author with the most publications was Park Hi-Joon.
      The keyword "cognitive behavioral therapy" was first for research developments
      with the highest citation burst. The five hot topics in acupuncture on depression
      were "acupuncture," "depression," "electro-acupuncture," "quality of life," and
      "anxiety." Conclusions: The results from this bibliometric study provide insight 
      into the research trends in acupuncture therapy for depression, and the current
      status and trends of the past decade, which may help researchers determine the
      current status, hotspots, and frontier trends in this field.

TI  - Landscape ecological concepts in planning: review of recent developments.
PG  - 2329-2345
LID - 10.1007/s10980-021-01193-y [doi]
AB  - Context: Landscape ecology as an interdisciplinary science has great potential to
      inform landscape planning, an integrated, collaborative practice on a regional
      scale. It is commonly assumed that landscape ecological concepts play a key role 
      in this quest. Objectives: The aim of the paper is to identify landscape
      ecological concepts that are currently receiving attention in the scientific
      literature, analyze the prevalence of these concepts and understand how these
      concepts can inform the steps of the planning processes, from goal establishment 
      to monitoring. Methods: We analyzed all empirical and overview papers that have
      been published in four key academic journals in the field of landscape ecology
      and landscape planning in the years 2015-2019 (n = 1918). Title, abstract and
      keywords of all papers were read in order to identify landscape ecological
      concepts. A keyword search was applied to identify the use of these and
      previously mentioned concepts in common steps of the planning cycle. Results: The
      concepts Structure, Function, Change, Scale, Landscape as human experience, Land 
      use, Landscape and ecosystem services, Green infrastructure, and Landscape
      resilience were prominently represented in the analyzed literature. Landscape
      ecological concepts were most often mentioned in context of the landscape
      analysis steps and least in context of goal establishment and monitoring.
      Conclusions: The current literature spots landscape ecological concepts with
      great potential to support landscape planning. However, future studies need to
      address directly how these concepts can inform all steps in the planning process.

TI  - autoBOT: evolving neuro-symbolic representations for explainable low resource
      text classification.
PG  - 989-1028
LID - 10.1007/s10994-021-05968-x [doi]
AB  - Learning from texts has been widely adopted throughout industry and science.
      While state-of-the-art neural language models have shown very promising results
      for text classification, they are expensive to (pre-)train, require large amounts
      of data and tuning of hundreds of millions or more parameters. This paper
      explores how automatically evolved text representations can serve as a basis for 
      explainable, low-resource branch of models with competitive performance that are 
      subject to automated hyperparameter tuning. We present autoBOT (automatic
      Bags-Of-Tokens), an autoML approach suitable for low resource learning scenarios,
      where both the hardware and the amount of data required for training are limited.
      The proposed approach consists of an evolutionary algorithm that jointly
      optimizes various sparse representations of a given text (including word,
      subword, POS tag, keyword-based, knowledge graph-based and relational features)
      and two types of document embeddings (non-sparse representations). The key idea
      of autoBOT is that, instead of evolving at the learner level, evolution is
      conducted at the representation level. The proposed method offers competitive
      classification performance on fourteen real-world classification tasks when
      compared against a competitive autoML approach that evolves ensemble models, as
      well as state-of-the-art neural language models such as BERT and RoBERTa.
      Moreover, the approach is explainable, as the importance of the parts of the
      input space is part of the final solution yielded by the proposed optimization
      procedure, offering potential for meta-transfer learning.

TI  - Tracking developments in artificial intelligence research: constructing and
      applying a new search strategy.
PG  - 3153-3192

AB  - Artificial intelligence, as an emerging and multidisciplinary domain of research 
      and innovation, has attracted growing attention in recent years. Delineating the 
      domain composition of artificial intelligence is central to profiling and
      tracking its development and trajectories. This paper puts forward a bibliometric
      definition for artificial intelligence which can be readily applied, including by
      researchers, managers, and policy analysts. Our approach starts with benchmark
      records of artificial intelligence captured by using a core keyword and
      specialized journal search. We then extract candidate terms from high frequency
      keywords of benchmark records, refine keywords and complement with the subject
      category "artificial intelligence". We assess our search approach by comparing it
      with other three recent search strategies of artificial intelligence, using a
      common source of articles from the Web of Science. Using this source, we then
      profile patterns of growth and international diffusion of scientific research in 
      artificial intelligence in recent years, identify top research sponsors in
      funding artificial intelligence and demonstrate how diverse disciplines
      contribute to the multidisciplinary development of artificial intelligence. We
      conclude with implications for search strategy development and suggestions of
      lines for further research.

TI  - Software review: The JATSdecoder package-extract metadata, abstract and sectioned
      text from NISO-JATS coded XML documents; Insights to PubMed central's open access
      database.
PG  - 1-17
LID - 10.1007/s11192-021-04162-z [doi]
AB  - JATSdecoder is a general toolbox which facilitates text extraction and analytical
      tasks on NISO-JATS coded XML documents. Its function JATSdecoder() outputs
      metadata, the abstract, the sectioned text and reference list as easy selectable 
      elements. One of the biggest repositories for open access full texts covering
      biology and the medical and health sciences is PubMed Central (PMC), with more
      than 3.2 million files. This report provides an overview of the PMC document
      collection processed with JATSdecoder(). The development of extracted tags is
      displayed for the full corpus over time and in greater detail for some meta tags.
      Possibilities and limitations for text miners working with scientific literature 
      are outlined. The NISO-JATS-tags are used quite consistently nowadays and allow a
      reliable extraction of metadata and text elements. International collaborations
      are more present than ever. There are obvious errors in the date stamps of some
      documents. Only about half of all articles from 2020 contain at least one author 
      listed with an author identification code. Since many authors share the same
      name, the identification of person-related content is problematic, especially for
      authors with Asian names. JATSdecoder() reliably extracts key metadata and text
      elements from NISO-JATS coded XML files. When combined with the rich, publicly
      available content within PMCs database, new monitoring and text mining approaches
      can be carried out easily. Any selection of article subsets should be carefully
      performed with in- and exclusion criteria on several NISO-JATS tags, as both the 
      subject and keyword tags are used quite inconsistently.

TI  - Stigma toward Wuhan people during the COVID-19 epidemic: an exploratory study
      based on social media.
PG  - 1958
LID - 10.1186/s12889-021-12001-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stigma associated with infectious diseases is common and causes
      various negative effects on stigmatized people. With Wuhan as the center of the
      COVID-19 outbreak in China, its people were likely to be the target of
      stigmatization. To evaluate the severity of stigmatization toward Wuhan people
      and provide necessary information for stigma mitigation, this study aimed to
      identify the stigmatizing attitudes toward Wuhan people and trace their changes
      as COVID-19 progresses in China by analyzing related posts on social media.
      METHODS: We collected 19,780 Weibo posts containing the keyword 'Wuhan people'
      and performed a content analysis to identify stigmatizing attitudes in the posts.
      Then, we divided our observation time into three periods and performed
      repeated-measures ANOVA to compare the differences in attitudes during the three 
      periods. RESULTS: The results showed that stigma was mild, with 2.46% of related 
      posts being stigmatizing. The percentages of stigmatizing posts differed
      significantly during the three periods. The percentages of 'Infectious' posts and
      'Stupid' posts were significantly different for the three periods. The percentage
      of 'Irresponsible' posts was not significantly different for the three periods.
      After government interventions, stigma did not decrease significantly, and stigma
      with the 'Infectious' attitude even increased. It was not until the government
      interventions took effect that stigma significantly reduced. CONCLUSIONS: This
      study found that stigma toward Wuhan people included diverse attitudes and
      changed at different periods. After government interventions but before they took
      effect, stigma with the 'Infectious' attitude increased. After government
      interventions took effect, general stigma and stigmas with 'Infectious' and
      'Stupid' attitudes decreased. This study constituted an important endeavor to
      understand the stigma toward Wuhan people in China during the COVID-19 epidemic. 
      Implications for stigma reduction and improvement of the public's perception
      during different periods of epidemic control are discussed.

TI  - Pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial infections and environmental factors: A
      review of the literature.
PG  - 106660
LID - S0954-6111(21)00368-1 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.rmed.2021.106660 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial (pNTM) infection is mainly
      acquired through the inhalation of bioaerosols. Nevertheless, behavioural
      restrictions are rarely given by clinicians to susceptible populations, in part
      because the available guidelines for pNTM management emphasize more diagnosis and
      treatment than prevention. Aim of this review is to clarify if pNTM prevention
      should routinely include recommendations about risk reducing behaviors. METHODS: 
      We used PubMed as biomedical database. We limited our search to the publication
      period 2000 to 2020 with selected keyword combinations including "nontuberculous 
      mycobacteria", "water", "soil", and "exposure". Titles and abstract of selected
      articles were systematically screened. Articles were included in the analysis if 
      they were published under free access through the digital library of the
      University of Brescia (Italy), and provided full text either in English, French, 
      German or Italian. Articles were excluded if the topic was beyond the aim of our 
      study. Finally, we selected 20 articles. RESULTS: Studies disagree in identifying
      the type of aerosol posing the highest risk for the development of pNTM
      infection. In the retrieved publications the colonization of household niches has
      been associated with a higher risk of pNTM disease, such as in the exposure to
      shower aerosols. Considering the non-household settings, the exposure to aerosols
      in indoor swimming and the higher soil exposure (>2 h/week) seem to correlate
      with a higher risk to develop pNTM disease. According to our findings, randomized
      behavioural intervention studies are missing. CONCLUSIONS: Stringent scientific
      evidence is missing to formulate recommendations on behavioural risk reduction
      for pNTM.

TI  - Acupuncture combined with traditional Chinese medicine preparation for the
      treatment of marrow suppression after chemotherapy: A protocol for systematic
      review and meta-analysis.
PG  - e27646
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000027646 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: From the perspective of evidence-based medicine, the efficacy and
      safety of combined therapy for marrow suppression after chemotherapy is still
      unclear. Given that there is no high-quality meta-analysis to incorporate
      existing evidence, the purpose of this protocol is to design a systematically
      review and meta-analysis of the level I evidence to ascertain the efficacy and
      safety of acupuncture combined with traditional Chinese medicine preparation for 
      marrow suppression after chemotherapy. METHODS: The following databases will be
      searched electronically by keyword combination mode: 4 British literature
      databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Cochrane Library, and 4 Chinese
      literature databases, including Chinese national knowledge infrastructure, VIP,
      and Wan fang database. The randomized controlled trials on acupuncture plus
      traditional Chinese medicine preparation for marrow suppression after
      chemotherapy will be included. The primary outcome is the elevation of
      hemoglobin, platelets, leukocytes, and neutrophils. The other outcomes include
      clinical symptoms, quality of life, and absolute value of reticulocyte. Risk bias
      analysis of the studies will be performed independently by 2 reviewers using the 
      Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. RESULTS: The review will add to the
      existing literature by showing compelling evidence and improved guidance in
      clinic settings. CONCLUSION: This protocol will provide a reliable theoretical
      basis for the following research.

TI  - Exploring the "Dark Matter" of Social Interaction: Systematic Review of a Decade 
      of Research in Spontaneous Interpersonal Coordination.
PG  - 718237
LID - 10.3389/fpsyg.2021.718237 [doi]
AB  - Interpersonal coordination is a research topic that has attracted considerable
      attention this last decade both due to a theoretical shift from intra-individual 
      to inter-individual processes and due to the development of new methods for
      recording and analyzing movements in ecological settings. Encompassing
      spatiotemporal behavioral matching, interpersonal coordination is considered as
      "social glue" due to its capacity to foster social bonding. However, the
      mechanisms underlying this effect are still unclear and recent findings suggest a
      complex picture. Goal-oriented joint action and spontaneous coordination are
      often conflated, making it difficult to disentangle the role of joint commitment 
      from unconscious mutual attunement. Consequently, the goals of the present
      article are twofold: (1) to illustrate the rapid expansion of interpersonal
      coordination as a research topic and (2) to conduct a systematic review of
      spontaneous interpersonal coordination, summarizing its latest developments and
      current challenges this last decade. By applying Rapid Automatic Keyword
      Extraction and Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithms, keywords were extracted
      from PubMed and Scopus databases revealing the large diversity of research topics
      associated with spontaneous interpersonal coordination. Using the same databases 
      and the keywords "behavioral matching," "interactional synchrony," and
      "interpersonal coordination," 1,213 articles were identified, extracted, and
      screened following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
      Meta-Analyses protocol. A total of 19 articles were selected using the following 
      inclusion criteria: (1) dynamic and spontaneous interactions between two
      unacquainted individuals (2) kinematic analyses, and (3) non-clinical and
      non-expert adult populations. The results of this systematic review stress the
      proliferation of various definitions and experimental paradigms that study
      perceptual and/or social influences on the emergence of spontaneous interpersonal
      coordination. As methods and indices used to quantify interpersonal coordination 
      differ from one study to another, it becomes difficult to establish a coherent
      picture. This review highlights the need to reconsider interpersonal coordination
      not as the pinnacle of social interactions but as a complex dynamical process
      that requires cautious interpretation. An interdisciplinary approach is necessary
      for building bridges across scattered research fields through opening a dialogue 
      between different theoretical frameworks and consequently provides a more
      ecological and holistic understanding of human social cognition.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To summarize the existing literature for several promising minimally
      invasive tests to measure disease activity in eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE).
      DATA SOURCES: Literature searches were performed using PubMed. Keyword
      combinations included eosinophilic esophagitis and minimally invasive techniques,
      including the esophageal string test, Cytosponge, transnasal endoscopy,
      technetium-labeled heparin, and noninvasive biomarkers. STUDY SELECTIONS:
      Retrospective and prospective observational studies, peer-reviewed reviews, and
      systematic reviews were selected. Data were reviewed and summarized. RESULTS:
      Various techniques have been developed in recent years to measure disease
      activity in EoE without the need for conventional endoscopy. Our review
      summarizes the data on these techniques, the benefits and limitations, and future
      directions for implementation in both research and clinical care. CONCLUSION:
      Tremendous progress has been made toward developing minimally invasive techniques
      to measure disease activity in EoE. Each of the techniques mentioned in this
      review has advantages and disadvantages, and some are closer to widespread use
      than others.

TI  - A Bibliometric Keyword and Term Analysis of the Articles Published in the Journal
      of Craniofacial Surgery Between 1995 and 2020.
PG  - 2263-2265
LID - 10.1097/SCS.0000000000007925 [doi]
AB  - ABSTRACT: The aim of this study is to analyze the terms in the abstract section
      and keywords of articles published in the Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (J
      Craniofac Surg) bibliometrically. Using the advanced search section in the Web of
      Science database on February 26, 2021, all articles published in the J Craniofac 
      Surg from 1995 to 2020 were listed. All records of the detected 11,888 articles
      were exported and both terms in the abstract and keywords used in the articles
      were determined through the VOSviewer (version 1.6.16) software. It was found
      that the 10 most common terms in the abstract were patient (n: 6820), study (n:
      4729), surgery (n: 3422), case (n: 3230), year (n: 2585), treatment (n: 2430),
      author (n: 2303) complication (n: 2150), month (n: 2061), and technique (n:
      2002), respectively. It was found that the 10 most common keywords were
      craniosynostosis (n: 408), distraction osteogenesis (n: 257), orthognathic
      surgery (n: 243), mandible (n: 225), cleft palate (n: 214), reconstruction (n:
      206), surgery (n: 157), cranioplasty (n: 150), cleft lip (n: 133), and computed
      tomography (n: 132), respectively. To the best of our knowledge, the current
      study is the first bibliometric keyword and term analysis in the field of
      craniofacial surgery. This study will enable us to have an idea about the past
      and current trends and the visibility of the articles published in the J
      Craniofac Surg.

TI  - Smoothness metrics for reaching performance after stroke. Part 1: which one to
      choose?
PG  - 154
LID - 10.1186/s12984-021-00949-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Smoothness is commonly used for measuring movement quality of the
      upper paretic limb during reaching tasks after stroke. Many different smoothness 
      metrics have been used in stroke research, but a 'valid' metric has not been
      identified. A systematic review and subsequent rigorous analysis of smoothness
      metrics used in stroke research, in terms of their mathematical definitions and
      response to simulated perturbations, is needed to conclude whether they are valid
      for measuring smoothness. Our objective was to provide a recommendation for
      metrics that reflect smoothness after stroke based on: (1) a systematic review of
      smoothness metrics for reaching used in stroke research, (2) the mathematical
      description of the metrics, and (3) the response of metrics to simulated changes 
      associated with smoothness deficits in the reaching profile. METHODS: The
      systematic review was performed by screening electronic databases using combined 
      keyword groups Stroke, Reaching and Smoothness. Subsequently, each metric
      identified was assessed with mathematical criteria regarding smoothness: (a)
      being dimensionless, (b) being reproducible, (c) being based on rate of change of
      position, and (d) not being a linear transform of other smoothness metrics. The
      resulting metrics were tested for their response to simulated changes in reaching
      using models of velocity profiles with varying reaching distances and durations, 
      harmonic disturbances, noise, and sub-movements. Two reaching tasks were
      simulated; reach-to-point and reach-to-grasp. The metrics that responded as
      expected in all simulation analyses were considered to be valid. RESULTS: The
      systematic review identified 32 different smoothness metrics, 17 of which were
      excluded based on mathematical criteria, and 13 more as they did not respond as
      expected in all simulation analyses. Eventually, we found that, for
      reach-to-point and reach-to-grasp movements, only Spectral Arc Length (SPARC) was
      found to be a valid metric. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this systematic review and
      simulation analyses, we recommend the use of SPARC as a valid smoothness metric
      in both reach-to-point and reach-to-grasp tasks of the upper limb after stroke.
      However, further research is needed to understand the time course of smoothness
      measured with SPARC for the upper limb early post stroke, preferably in
      longitudinal studies.

AB  - The present study examines the existing knowledge and intellectual structure on
      contagious diseases and tourism to map the development of the concept through
      collaborative networks. Utilising the Scopus and Web of Science bibliometric
      databases, 328 research records were extracted through keyword searching and
      forward referencing approaches. Based on these records, the study conducted
      bibliometric and content analysis to diagnose core themes in the field. The
      present study's findings are helpful for academia and industry to aid their
      existing knowledge about contagious diseases, particularly its timeline,
      geographical spread, and development of coherent themes. A rigorous literature
      review revealed that the scholarly work in the domain of contagious diseases and 
      tourism revolves around four important themes, namely COVID-19, SARS, Crisis
      management, and Sustainability. The first theme revolves around COVID-19,
      highlighting about the impact of COVID-19 on different sectors of the TTH
      industry, countries, stakeholders, and contexts. Also, researchers foresee
      COVID-19 as a catalyst to reshape the tourism industry. The next group of studies
      explained the handling of SARS, particularly by Asian countries. The third
      cluster elaborated on different stages of crisis and strategies adopted by
      organizations and countries to manage the crisis. Lastly, a handful of studies in
      the corpus stated that sustainability in tourism needs to be understood beyond
      saving the environment and aspiring prosperous travel and tourism industry. The
      study also suggested the scope of future work.

TI  - Melatonin-A New Prospect in Prostate and Breast Cancer Management.
PG  - e18124
LID - 10.7759/cureus.18124 [doi]
AB  - Cancer is a known cause of mortality globally. The management of cancer has been 
      influenced periodically by diverse scientific research for early detection to
      promote remission and improve quality of life. One of these advancements is the
      prospect of melatonin (n-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) in managing prostate and
      breast cancers. Melatonin exerts its oncostatic effect by inhibiting
      angiogenesis, preventing cancer spread and growth, and improving the sensitivity 
      of cancer cells to radiation and chemotherapy in both prostate and breast cancer.
      This review aims to highlight some of the current studies on melatonin's effect
      on prostate and breast cancers. We reviewed articles and two randomized
      controlled trials (RCT) that highlighted the mechanism of melatonin in combating 
      tumorigenesis of these cancers. Articles and RCT studies were obtained by
      searching PubMed using regular and Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) keyword search 
      strategy. The majority of the articles reviewed supported the use of melatonin in
      cancer management since inhibition of angiogenesis, cancer proliferation,
      invasion of normal cells by tumor cells, and improvement in chemotherapeutic and 
      radiation therapy were achieved with its use. In addition, melatonin was also
      protective against prostate and breast cancers in the general population. Despite
      the benefits of melatonin in cancer management, most of the studies done were in 
      vivo and in vitro studies, and more studies in human subjects are encouraged to
      confirm the positive therapeutic use of melatonin.

TI  - Googling for Suicide-Content and Quality Analysis of Suicide-Related Websites:
      Thematic Analysis.
PG  - e29146
LID - 10.2196/29146 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Suicide represents a public health concern, imposing a dramatic
      burden. Prosuicide websites are "virtual pathways" facilitating a rise in
      suicidal behaviors, especially among socially isolated, susceptible individuals. 
      OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to characterize suicide-related webpages in
      the Italian language. METHODS: The first 5 most commonly used search engines in
      Italy (ie, Bing, Virgilio, Yahoo, Google, and Libero) were mined using the term
      "suicidio" (Italian for suicide). For each search, the first 100 webpages were
      considered. Websites resulting from each search were collected and duplicates
      deleted so that unique webpages could be analyzed and rated with the HONcode
      instrument. RESULTS: A total of 65 webpages were included: 12.5% (8/64) were
      antisuicide and 6.3% (4/64) explicitly prosuicide. The majority of the included
      websites had a mixed or neutral attitude toward suicide (52/64, 81.2%) and had
      informative content and purpose (39/64, 60.9%). Most webpages targeted
      adolescents as an age group (38/64, 59.4%), contained a reference to other
      psychiatric disorders or comorbidities (42/64, 65.6%), included
      medical/professional supervision or guidance (45/64, 70.3%), lacked figures or
      pictures related to suicide (41/64, 64.1%), and did not contain any access
      restraint (62/64, 96.9%). The major shortcoming to this study is the small sample
      size of webpages analyzed and the search limited to the keyword "suicide."
      CONCLUSIONS: Specialized mental health professionals should try to improve their 
      presence online by providing high-quality material.

TI  - Future Challenges for Work-Related Health Promotion in Europe: A Data-Based
      Theoretical Reflection.
LID - 10996 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph182010996 [doi]
AB  - This contribution is a theoretical reflection based on statistical and empirical 
      data as well as concepts proposed by other authors or institutions. Based on the 
      thesis that the respective social developments equally influence and limit the
      orientation and design of workplace health promotion, this article deals with the
      challenges that arise from the contemporary social, political and economic
      developments for a needs-oriented and effective workplace health promotion. On
      the basis of a historical review of the lines of development in workplace health 
      promotion, beginning with the Ottawa Charter in 1986, the field of tension in
      which work-related health promotion approaches generally operate is first
      outlined. Based on the results of a keyword search in relevant European
      statistics databases and specialized databases on the topics of demographic
      change, labor migration and digitalization and flexibilization of work, current
      development trends in the world of work are traced, priority desiderata for a
      future design of health promotion are derived from these, and their chances of
      realization are reflected upon. On the basis of the data collected, it becomes
      clear that today's world of work is characterized by multidimensional
      diversification processes, which are accompanied by the risk of worsening social 
      inequalities. The conclusion is that future concepts of workplace health
      promotion must be more universal than previous approaches, which are often
      limited to the focus of individual behavioral prevention. The attempt to promote 
      workplace health promotion with economic benefit arguments also runs the risk of 
      reinforcing social inequality. The task of effective workplace health promotion, 
      conversely, must be to initiate critical reflection on current priorities.

TI  - Wearable Wireless Biosensor Technology for Monitoring Cattle: A Review.
LID - 2779 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani11102779 [doi]
AB  - The review aimed to collect information about the wearable wireless sensor system
      (WWSS) for cattle and to conduct a systematic literature review on the accuracy
      of predicting the physiological parameters of these systems. The WWSS was
      categorized as an ear tag, halter, neck collar, rumen bolus, leg tag,
      tail-mounted, and vaginal mounted types. Information was collected from a
      web-based search on Google, then manually curated. We found about 60 WWSSs
      available in the market; most sensors included an accelerometer. The literature
      evaluating the WWSS performance was collected through a keyword search in Scopus.
      Among the 1875 articles identified, 46 documents that met our criteria were
      selected for further meta-analysis. Meta-analysis was conducted on the
      performance values (e.g., correlation, sensitivity, and specificity) for
      physiological parameters (e.g., feeding, activity, and rumen conditions). The
      WWSS showed high performance in most parameters, although some parameters (e.g., 
      drinking time) need to be improved, and considerable heterogeneity of performance
      levels was observed under various conditions (average I(2) = 76%). Nevertheless, 
      some of the literature provided insufficient information on evaluation criteria, 
      including experimental conditions and gold standards, to confirm the reliability 
      of the reported performance. Therefore, guidelines for the evaluation criteria
      for studies evaluating WWSS performance should be drawn up.

TI  - Pain Behavior of People with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Coded
      with the New PAIC-15 and Validation of Its Arabic Translation.
LID - 1254 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/brainsci11101254 [doi]
AB  - Pain management necessitates assessment of pain; the gold standard being
      self-report. Among individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities
      (IDD), self-report may be limited and therefore indirect methods for pain
      assessment are required. A new, internationally agreed upon and user-friendly
      observational tool was recently published-the Pain Assessment in Impaired
      Cognition (PAIC-15). The current study's aims were: to test the use of the
      PAIC-15 in assessing pain among people with IDD and to translate the PAIC-15 into
      Arabic for dissemination among Arabic-speaking professionals. Pain behavior
      following experimental pressure stimuli was analyzed among 30 individuals with
      IDD and 15 typically developing controls (TDCs). Translation of the PAIC followed
      the forward-backward approach; and reliability between the two versions and
      between raters was calculated. Observational scores with the PAIC-15 exhibited a 
      stimulus-response relationship with pressure stimulation. Those of the IDD group 
      were greater than those of the TDC group. The overall agreement between the
      English and Arabic versions was high (ICC = 0.89); single items exhibited
      moderate to high agreement levels. Inter-rater reliability was high (ICC = 0.92).
      Both versions of the PAIC-15 are feasible and reliable tools to record pain
      behavior in individuals with IDD. Future studies using these tools in clinical
      settings are warranted.

TI  - Leveraging internet search data to assess prevalence, interest, and unmet needs
      of sarcoidosis in Germany.
PG  - 20841
LID - 10.1038/s41598-021-00131-x [doi]
AB  - Sarcoidosis is a multisystemic disease of connective tissue with granuloma
      formation of unknown etiology and unclear prevalence. Internet search data has
      been shown to correlate with disease incidences and the population's interest as 
      well as seasonal variations. Accordingly, aim of this study was to leverage
      internet search data on sarcoidosis-related keywords to identify unmet needs,
      geographical and seasonal factors influencing sarcoidosis and estimating its
      prevalence. In this retrospective longitudinal study, Google Ads Keyword Planner 
      was used to determine the internet search volume of terms related to sarcoidosis 
      across Germany as a whole and in 17 major German cities between July 2015 and
      June 2019. Identified keywords were qualitatively categorized, converted into
      number of searches per 100,000 inhabitants and analyzed including regional and
      seasonal differences. With 3,068,200 queries and 425 different
      sarcoidosis-related search terms in the studied time period, the search volume
      was very high for a rare disease. Most searches (67.9%) related to general
      disease information with "sarcoidosis", "Lofgren's syndrome", "sarcoidosis lung",
      "Morbus Boeck" and "neurosarcoidosis" as the top five keywords. Searches per
      100,000 inhabitants were comparable in all 17 cities but higher than in Germany
      as a whole. Overall, the search volume increased from 2015 to 2019 and peaked
      annually in European springtime with annual lows in European autumn and winter
      months. The overall high search volume suggests an unmet need for
      sarcoidosis-related information and a diagnostic gap. Seasonal fluctuations
      indicate environmental as well as climatic factors that may influence
      sarcoidosis.

TI  - Ethnotherapeutic Uses and Phytochemical Composition of Physalis peruviana L.: An 
      Overview.
PG  - 5212348
LID - 10.1155/2021/5212348 [doi]
AB  - Background: Plant-derived medicines are widespread and continue to increase in
      traditional and modern medicine, especially in developing countries. Physalis
      peruviana L. is among the most used plants in conventional medication worldwide. 
      This review aimed to highlight the ethnotherapeutic uses and phytochemical status
      of identified compounds in P. peruviana. Methods: Data were collected from Google
      Scholar, PubMed/Medline, SciFinder, Science Direct, Scopus, the Wiley Online
      Library, Web of Science, and any other helpful search engine using Physalis
      peruviana as the primary keyword. Results: Some countries, worldwide, use P.
      peruviana in their traditional medicine system to manage diverse ailments, mainly
      diseases and gastrointestinal tract disorders (25.33%). Leaf was the mostly used 
      part (49.28%), prepared by decoction (31.58%) and overall administrated orally
      (53.57%) as the main route of admission. Around 502 phytoconstituents were
      identified in different plant parts, especially fruit (38.19%) ethanol/ethyl
      acetate extract. In most cases (36.17%), the solvent of the extract was not
      specified. Several phytochemical classes were found in the plant, especially
      terpenes (26.09%) and phenolic compounds (14.94%). Esters were also abundant
      (11.55%). In the terpenes category, carotenoids were the most abundant (11.15%
      followed by monoterpenes (8.76%) and diterpenes (3.18%). However, flavonoids
      (5.17%) followed by cinnamic acid derivatives (3.99%), monophenolic compounds
      (1.79%), and phenolic acids (1.33 M) are the most reported phenolic compounds.
      Hexadecanoic acid (palmitic acid) was the most cited (five times). Conclusion: P.
      peruviana plays an essential role in managing diseases in some countries and is
      rich in chemical compounds, which need to be isolated and investigated
      pharmacologically before clinical trials.

TI  - ARE ENTEROTYPES IN OBESE MODIFIED BY BARIATRIC SURGERY, THE USE OF PROBIOTIC
      SUPPLEMENTS AND FOOD HABITS?

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Studies suggest that bariatric surgery, use of probiotic
      supplements and the dietary pattern can change enterotypes, as well as the entire
      microbial population. OBJECTIVE: To verify the influence of bariatric surgery,
      the use of probiotic supplements and eating habits on enterotypes in obese
      patients. METHODS: Articles published between the 2015 and 2020 were searched in 
      Lilacs and PubMed with the headings: probiotics, eating behavior, food
      consumption, food, diet, microbiota, gastrointestinal microbiome, bariatric
      surgery, gastric bypass and the keyword enterotype in Portuguese, English and
      Spanish. RESULTS: Of the 260 articles found, only studies carried out in obese
      adults relating changes in the enterotype after bariatric surgery or use of
      probiotics or dietary patterns and original articles were selected. In the end,
      eight papers on enterotype change and bariatric surgery were selected and
      categorized, four on the relationship between food consumption and microbiota and
      one on the effects of probiotics on enterotypes. CONCLUSION: The microbial
      structure is widely modified after bariatric surgery, since the use of probiotic 
      supplement does not bring lasting changes. Enterotypes appear to be shaped by
      long-term dietary patterns, can modulate how nutrients are metabolized and can be
      a useful biomarker to improve clinical management.

TI  - Nature-based interventions for bereavement care: a scoping review protocol.
LID - 10.11124/JBIES-21-00215 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this scoping review is to understand the types of
      nature-based interventions currently used in bereavement care and to map the
      theories of change explaining how such interventions may support bereavement
      care. INTRODUCTION: Bereavement can be associated with adverse psychosocial
      health outcomes. Nature-based interventions have been shown to have positive
      health and well-being outcomes, and offer diverse and flexible design and
      delivery options. However, this is an emerging field, and there is a need to
      explore the literature on the different types of nature-based interventions used 
      in bereavement care and to identify the underpinning theories of change.
      INCLUSION CRITERIA: This review will include studies or reviews of participants
      who have experienced bereavement following the death of a loved one, and who have
      taken part in a nature-based intervention (eg, animal-assisted therapy, care
      farming, therapeutic horticulture, community gardens). Considering all nature
      contexts and geographic locations, this review will include studies that explore 
      the role of nature-based interventions in bereavement care. METHODS: Searches
      will be conducted in eight databases (Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, PsycINFO,
      CINAHL, Social Science Database (ProQuest), PTSDpubs (ProQuest), and Research
      Library: Health and Medicine (ProQuest)). Manual searches of reference lists of
      included full-text articles and keyword searches of prominent journals will be
      conducted. Data on the type of nature-based intervention, target sample, health
      outcomes, measures and methods used, and theory of change will be extracted from 
      selected articles. The data extraction results will be presented in tabular
      format along with a narrative summary.

TI  - Targeting microRNA for improved skin health.
PG  - e374
LID - 10.1002/hsr2.374 [doi]
AB  - Background: In human skin, miRNAs have important regulatory roles and are
      involved in the development, morphogenesis, and maintenance by influencing cell
      proliferation, differentiation, immune regulation, and wound healing. MiRNAs have
      been investigated for many years in various skin disorders such as atopic
      dermatitis, psoriasis, as well as malignant tumors. Only during recent times,
      cosmeceutical use of molecules/natural active ingredients to regulate miRNA
      expression for significant advances in skin health/care product development was
      recognized. Aim: To review miRNAs with the potential to maintain and boost skin
      health and avoid premature aging by improving barrier function, preventing
      photoaging, hyperpigmentation, and chronological aging/senescence. Methods: Most 
      of the cited articles were found through literature search on PubMed. The main
      search criteria was a keyword "skin" in combination with the following words:
      miRNA, photoaging, UV, barrier, aging, exposome, acne, wound healing,
      pigmentation, pollution, and senescence. Most of the articles reviewed for
      relevancy were published during the past 10 years. Results: All results are
      summarized in Figure 1, and they are based on cited references. Conclusions:
      Thus, regulating miRNAs expression is a promising approach for novel therapy not 
      only for targeting skin diseases but also for cosmeceutical interventions aiming 
      to boost skin health.

      stratification with machine learning natural language processing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The penicillin adverse drug reaction (ADR) label is common in
      electronic health records (EHRs). However, there is significant misclassification
      between allergy and intolerance within the EHR and most patients can be
      delabelled after an immunologic assessment. Machine learning natural language
      processing may be able to assist with the categorisation and risk stratification 
      of penicillin ADRs. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to use text entered into
      an EHR to derive and evaluate machine learning models to classify penicillin ADRs
      and assess the risk of true allergy. METHODS: Machine learning natural language
      processing was applied to free-text penicillin ADR data extracted from a public
      health system EHR. The model was developed by training on labelled dataset. ADR
      entries were split into training and testing datasets and used to develop and
      test a variety of machine learning models. These were compared to categorisation 
      with a simple algorithm using keyword search. RESULTS: The best performing model 
      for the classification of penicillin ADRs as being consistent with allergy or
      intolerance was the artificial neural network (AUC 0.994, sensitivity 0.99,
      specificity 0.96). The artificial neural network also achieved the highest AUC in
      the classification of high- or low-risk of true allergy (AUC 0.988, sensitivity
      0.99, specificity 0.99). All ADR labels were able to be classified using these
      machine learning models, whereas a small proportion were unclassifiable using the
      simple algorithm as they contained no keywords. CONCLUSION: Machine learning
      natural language processing performed similarly to expert criteria in classifying
      and risk stratifying penicillin ADRs labels. These models outperformed simpler
      algorithms in their ability to interpret free-text data contained in the EHR. The
      automated evaluation of penicillin ADR labels may allow real-time risk
      stratification to facilitate delabelling and improve the specificity of
      prescribing alerts.

TI  - Applying text mining to identify relevant literature in food science: Cold
      denaturation as a case study.
PG  - 4851-4864
LID - 10.1111/1750-3841.15940 [doi]
AB  - In a research environment characterized by the five V's of big data, volume,
      velocity, variety, value, and veracity, the need to develop tools that quickly
      screen a large number of publications into relevant work is an increasing area of
      concern, and the data-rich food industry is no exception. Here, a combination of 
      latent Dirichlet allocation and food keyword searches were employed to analyze
      and filter a dataset of 6102 publications about cold denaturation. After using
      the Python toolkit generated in this work, the approach yielded 22 topics that
      provide background and insight on the direction of research in this field, as
      well as identified the publications in this dataset which are most pertinent to
      the food industry with precision and recall of 0.419 and 0.949, respectively.
      Precision is related to the relevance of a paper in the filtered dataset and the 
      recall represents papers which were not identified in the screening method.
      Lastly, gaps in the literature based on keyword trends are identified to improve 
      the knowledge base of cold denaturation as it relates to the food industry. This 
      approach is generalizable to any similarly organized dataset, and the code is
      available upon request. Practical Application: A common problem in research is
      that when you are an expert in one field, learning about another field is
      difficult, because you may lack the vocabulary and background needed to read
      cutting edge literature from a new discipline. The Python toolkit developed in
      this research can be applied by any researcher that is new to a field to identify
      what the key literature is, what topics they should familiarize themselves with, 
      and what the current trends are in the field. Using this structure, researchers
      can greatly speed up how they identify new areas to research and find new
      projects.

TI  - COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy on Social Media: Building a Public Twitter Data Set of
      Antivaccine Content, Vaccine Misinformation, and Conspiracies.
PG  - e30642
LID - 10.2196/30642 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: False claims about COVID-19 vaccines can undermine public trust in
      ongoing vaccination campaigns, posing a threat to global public health.
      Misinformation originating from various sources has been spreading on the web
      since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Antivaccine activists have also
      begun to use platforms such as Twitter to promote their views. To properly
      understand the phenomenon of vaccine hesitancy through the lens of social media, 
      it is of great importance to gather the relevant data. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, 
      we describe a data set of Twitter posts and Twitter accounts that publicly
      exhibit a strong antivaccine stance. The data set is made available to the
      research community via our AvaxTweets data set GitHub repository. We characterize
      the collected accounts in terms of prominent hashtags, shared news sources, and
      most likely political leaning. METHODS: We started the ongoing data collection on
      October 18, 2020, leveraging the Twitter streaming application programming
      interface (API) to follow a set of specific antivaccine-related keywords. Then,
      we collected the historical tweets of the set of accounts that engaged in
      spreading antivaccination narratives between October 2020 and December 2020,
      leveraging the Academic Track Twitter API. The political leaning of the accounts 
      was estimated by measuring the political bias of the media outlets they shared.
      RESULTS: We gathered two curated Twitter data collections and made them publicly 
      available: (1) a streaming keyword-centered data collection with more than 1.8
      million tweets, and (2) a historical account-level data collection with more than
      135 million tweets. The accounts engaged in the antivaccination narratives lean
      to the right (conservative) direction of the political spectrum. The vaccine
      hesitancy is fueled by misinformation originating from websites with already
      questionable credibility. CONCLUSIONS: The vaccine-related misinformation on
      social media may exacerbate the levels of vaccine hesitancy, hampering progress
      toward vaccine-induced herd immunity, and could potentially increase the number
      of infections related to new COVID-19 variants. For these reasons, understanding 
      vaccine hesitancy through the lens of social media is of paramount importance.
      Because data access is the first obstacle to attain this goal, we published a
      data set that can be used in studying antivaccine misinformation on social media 
      and enable a better understanding of vaccine hesitancy.

TI  - Assessing cognitive toxicity in early phase trials - What are we missing?
LID - 10.1002/pon.5834 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Novel therapies, such as, small protein molecule inhibitors and
      immunotherapies are first tested clinically in Phase I trials. Moving on to later
      phase trials and ultimately standard practice. A key aim of these early clinical 
      trials is to define a toxicity profile; however, the emphasis is often on safety.
      The concern is cognitive toxicity is poorly studied in this context and may be
      under-reported. The aim of this review is to map evidence of cognitive
      assessment, toxicity, and confounding factors within reports from Phase I trials 
      and consider putative mechanisms of impairment aligned with mechanisms of novel
      therapies. METHODS: A scoping review methodology was applied to the search of
      databases, including Embase, MEDLINE, Clinicaltrials.gov. A [keyword search was
      conducted, results screened for duplication then inclusion/exclusion criteria
      applied. Articles were further screened for relevance; data organised into
      categories and charted in a tabular format]. Evidence was collated and summarised
      into a narrative synthesis. RESULTS: Despite the availability of robust ways to
      assess cognitive function, these are not routinely included in the conduct of
      early clinical trials. Reports of cognitive toxicity in early Phase I trials are 
      limited and available evidence on this shows that a proportion of patients
      experience impaired cognitive function over the course of participating in a
      Phase I trial. Links are identified between the targeted action of some novel
      therapies and putative mechanisms of cognitive impairment. CONCLUSION: The review
      provides rationale for research investigating cognitive function in this context.
      A study exploring the cognitive function of patients on Phase I trials and the
      feasibility of formally assessing this within early clinical trials is currently 
      underway at the Royal Marsden.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia (PE) is a severe hypertension-related disorder occurring
      during pregnancy that leads to significant mortality and morbidity in both the
      foetus and mother. Atractylenolide (ATL), a traditional Chinese natural agent
      isolated from the herb Atractylodes macrocephala, exhibits a series of
      pharmacological activities, including anti-oxidative stress and anti-inflammatory
      effects. PURPOSE: The impacts of ATL on apoptosis and oxidative stress in
      HTR-8/SVneo cells during PE development was investigated. STUDY DESIGN: We
      identified ATL by an overlap analysis of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems
      Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP) database using the keyword
      'gestational hypertension' and Traditional Chinese Medicine (Batman-TCM) database
      using the keyword 'Atractylodes macrocephala'. METHODS: Cell viability,
      proliferation, and migration were detected by CCK-8, EdU, and transwell assays.
      Flow cytometry and 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate were used to assess
      apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. RESULTS: EdU and CCK-8 assays
      demonstrated that ATL significantly enhanced the viability of HTR-8/SVneo cells. 
      Transwell assays showed that ATL remarkably induced the migration of HTR-8/SVneo 
      cells. Moreover, ROS production in HTR-8/SVneo cells was induced by H2O2, whilst 
      ATL alleviated this H2O2-induced ROS production and apoptosis in cells.
      CONCLUSION: ATL attenuated apoptosis and oxidative stress in HTR-8/SVneo cells in
      PE by activating the MAPK/ERK signalling pathway. ATL has potential to be
      utilized as a potential therapeutic candidate for PE.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the linguistic changes of transgender-related resources
      prior to 1999 to create a comprehensive dataset of resources using an
      ontology-derived search system, laying a framework for ontology-based reviews to 
      be used in informatics. METHODS: We analyzed 77 bibliographies and 11 databases
      for transgender resources published prior to 31 December 1999. We used 858
      variants of the term "transgender" to identify resources. Individual sources were
      tagged by subject matter and major conceptual terminology usage. We evaluated the
      accuracy of a Gender, Sex, and Sexual Orientation (GSSO) ontology-based mechanism
      on tagging relevant literature searches. RESULTS: We identified 3,058 sources in 
      19 languages. Primary subjects covered included surgery, psychology, psychiatry, 
      endocrinology, and sexology. The GSSO-based tagging mechanism correctly tagged
      97.7% of MEDLINE resources as transgender-related. DISCUSSION: The GSSO-based
      tagging mechanism was more effective than keyword-specific elucidations of
      terminologically complex literature and was just as effective at manual
      identification of subjects discussed within resources. Diverse language relating 
      to transgender persons can be identified using the GSSO, which can also be used
      for structured literature review based on subject matter thus improving research 
      in the area.

TI  - [ALPK3 gene-related pediatric cardiomyopathy with craniofacial-skeletal features:
      a report and literature review].
PG  - 787-792
LID - 10.3760/cma.j.cn112140-20210222-00150 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To explore the clinical characteristics and mutation spectrum of
      ALPK3-related pediatric cardiomyopathy and craniofacial-skeletal abnormalities in
      children. Methods: The clinical data during a follow-up of 11 years including
      clinical features, echocardiogram, electrocardiogram, cardiac magnetic resonance,
      genetic testing, and other data of a child firstly diagnosed with ALPK3
      gene-related cardiomyopathy and craniofacial-skeletal abnormalities in China were
      collected retrospectively. The literatures containing the keyword of "ALPK3 gene"
      published in the China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang database and
      PubMed were collected up to November 2020. Then, the clinical features and gene
      mutations of ALPK3 gene-related pediatric cardiomyopathy with
      craniofacial-skeletal features were summarized. Results: A female patient aged 10
      months who presented with an enlarged heart for 2 months, was admitted to the
      hospital and initially diagnosed with endocardial elastic fibrosis. The
      echocardiography showed features of dilated left ventricle (LV) and LV systolic
      dysfunction. Low-set ears, webbed neck, a grade 2/6 systolic murmur at lower left
      sternal area and bilateral absent flexion creases of dig were observed. After
      treatment, the size and function of the heart recovered to normal at age 13
      months. However, the ventricular septum and LV wall were thicker than normal
      values. Then, the diagnosis was revised to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy(HCM) and
      suspected congenital malformation syndrome. LV hypertrophy (LVH) progressed
      slowly before the age of 8 years and then progressed rapidly. At age 9 years,
      compound heterozygous ALPK3 mutations (c.721dup, p.Y241Lfs*42(exon 1) and
      c.4840C>T, p.R1614*(exon 10)) were detected in the proband and the mutations had 
      not been reported previously. Then, the final diagnosis of ALPK3 gene-related
      pediatric cardiomyopathy with craniofacial-skeletal features was made. During the
      follow up of 11 years, regular follow-up echocardiographic images showed
      progressive LVH. At age 11 years, electrocardiogram showed LVH, ST-T changes in
      multiple-lead, T wave inversion, and prolonged QT intervals. Cardiac magnetic
      resonance showed biventricular hypertrophy and late gadolinium enhancement showed
      non-uniform enhancement of left and right ventricular myocardium. A total of 7
      articles published in English were retrieved, and no Chinese literature was
      found. Twenty-eight cases were reported in the articles plus the patient in this 
      study. Twenty-four mutations were reported worldwide, 18 patients carried
      homozygous mutations and 10 patients compound heterozygous mutations. Eleven
      patients showed dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) at early stage of disease, and 10 of
      them transitioned to HCM at the disease progression stage. Eight patients
      presented with HCM at early stage of disease. Nine patients initially exhibited a
      mixed phenotype of DCM and HCM, and 6 of them eventually progressed to HCM.
      Electrocardiogram showed prolonged QT interval. Extracardiac features included
      short stature, special face, cleft palate, webbed neck, joint contracture, and
      scoliosis, etc. Conclusions: Progressive myocardial hypertrophy is a major
      feature of ALPK3 gene-related cardiomyopathy with craniofacial-skeletal
      malformations. Precise diagnosis depends on molecular genetic techniques. More
      cases should be accumulated for further analysis on the genotype-phenotype
      correlation and prognosis assessment.

TI  - Parameters Affecting the Retention Force of CAD/CAM Telescopic Crowns: A Focused 
      Review of In Vitro Studies.
LID - 4429 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm10194429 [doi]
AB  - Telescopic systems constructed using computer aided design and computer aided
      manufacture (CAD/CAM) can overcome many drawbacks associated with conventionally 
      constructed ones. Since retention is considered the most important function of
      these retainers, this scoping review aimed to discuss and summarize the
      parameters that affect this function in CAD/CAM-manufactured telescopic crowns
      and to compare their retention force values with the recommended retention force.
      An electronic search was done in Pubmed and Google Scholar databases using
      different keyword combinations to find the related articles. Seventeen articles
      that follow the eligibility criteria for this review were selected and analyzed
      for detection of each of the tested parameters and their effect on retention
      force. The parameters tested in these articles were divided into parameters
      related to design, manufacturing, material type, and test condition. Regardless
      of the effect of these parameters, the retention force values recorded in most of
      the selected studies laid within or were higher than the recommended retention
      force (2.5-10 N), which indicated the need to design and set the combination of
      materials of telescopic systems according to oral biomechanics.

TI  - Contemporary Mechanical Circulatory Support with Continuous Flow Biventricular
      Assist Devices: A Systematic Review.
LID - 10.1097/CRD.0000000000000421 [doi]
AB  - As the incidence of heart failure increases, so too has that of biventricular
      failure. While transplantation remains the gold standard therapy for end-stage
      heart failure, the limited organ supply has increased the need for durable
      mechanical circulatory support. We therefore sought to conduct a systematic
      review of continuous flow ventricular assist devices in a biventricular
      configuration (CF-BiVAD). An electronic search of PubMed and Cumulative Index to 
      Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases was performed using the
      keyword "BIVAD". Studies were reviewed to identify discrete variables, including 
      implant indication, INTERMACs profile, timing of implant, mean age and BMI, and
      the anticoagulation/antiplatelet regimens employed post implant. Outcomes of
      interest included mortality and the incidence of thrombus, bleeding, infection,
      stroke and renal failure. A total of 25 studies met inclusion criteria. No single
      variable was consistently reported, with only four studies reporting all five
      adverse effects. INTERMACs profile at implant and anticoagulation/antiplatelet
      regimen were reported in less than 50% of studies. Of those reporting mortality, 
      there was a wide range of follow-up, from less than six months to >10 years, and 
      the survival rate was similarly widely variable. Additionally, more than 50% of
      studies failed to isolate CF-BiVAD from alternative means of biventricular
      support, such as temporary support platforms, TAH, and pulsatile VADs. Therefore 
      high-quality quantitative analysis is not possible. In summary, CF-BiVAD
      literature has a very heterogenous reporting of data. Standard reporting criteria
      may allow for future analyses to determine which patient characteristics portend 
      a favorable outcome with CF-BiVAD implantation.

TI  - Bibliometric analysis of global research trends on male osteoporosis: a neglected
      field deserves more attention.
PG  - 154
LID - 10.1007/s11657-021-01016-2 [doi]
AB  - We analyzed the knowledge structure, current status, and future directions of
      3243 publications on male osteoporosis by employing bibliometric analysis. Our
      results indicated that Osteoporosis International was the most influential
      journal in this field. And the study of epidemiology and risk factors has been
      recognized as a hot research topic in recent years. This study also calls for
      more attention to be given on male osteoporosis research. INTRODUCTION: Male
      osteoporosis is increasing as a serious health problem worldwide with the aging
      of population. However, a comprehensive understanding of the current status and
      future trends in this field is lacking to date. The goal of the present study was
      to summarize and visualize the knowledge framework, research hotspots, and
      emerging trends of male osteoporosis research based on the bibliometric method.
      METHODS: Scientific publications regarding male osteoporosis from 1998 to 2020
      were downloaded from the SCIE database. VOSviewer, CiteSpace, and online
      bibliometric website were used for this study. The main analyses include
      cooperative relationships between countries/institutions/authors, co-citation
      analysis of authors/journals, and co-occurrence analysis of keywords/subject
      categories, as well as analyses on keyword/reference bursts. RESULTS: A total of 
      3243 publications with 128,751 citations were identified. Despite experiencing a 
      period of increase in the number of publications, incentives for conducting male 
      osteoporosis research seem to have decreased during recent years. The USA has the
      most prominent contributions, as reflected by most publications and the highest
      H-index value. Oregon Health and Science University was the most prolific
      institution within this domain. The most influential academic journal was
      Osteoporosis International. Keywords were categorized into four clusters: basic
      research, epidemiology and risk factors, diagnostic studies, treatment and
      fracture prevention. Burst keyword detection suggested that the following
      research directions including "obesity," "zoledronic acid," "DXA,"
      "inflammation," "fall," "microarchitecture," and "sarcopenia" remain research
      hotspots in the near future and deserve our further attention. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      is the first bibliometric analysis that provides a comprehensive overview of male
      osteoporosis research, which may provide helpful references for investigators to 
      further explore hot issues in this field.

PG  - 1-32
LID - 10.1007/s11135-021-01251-2 [doi]
AB  - Blockchain can function as a foundational technology with numerous applications
      in smart cities. The objective of this paper is twofold. First, it provides a
      detailed overview of the extant literature on blockchain applications in smart
      cities; second, it reveals the trends and suggests future research directions for
      scholars who wish to contribute to this rapidly growing field. We conducted a
      bibliometric review using a keyword co-occurrence network and article co-citation
      analysis. The analysis includes the assessment of 148 articles published between 
      2016 and 2020 in 76 academic journals. The review results demonstrate that the
      number of articles devoted to the study of blockchain applications and smart
      cities has increased exponentially in recent years. More importantly, the
      research identifies some of the most influential studies in this area. The paper 
      discusses trends and highlights the challenges related to the deployment of
      blockchain in smart cities. To the authors' best knowledge, this represents the
      first study to review the literature from leading journals on blockchain
      applications in smart cities using bibliometric techniques.

TI  - Burnout prevalence among European physicians: a systematic review and
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 259-273
LID - 10.1007/s00420-021-01782-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Our objective was to assess burnout prevalence rates among physicians
      practicing in Europe (regardless of their specialty) taking into account the main
      approaches used to define burnout with the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) tool. 
      METHODS: A systematic review was carried out from 2006 to 2018. A keyword request
      was obtained using the PubMed/Medline, Web of Science and Banque de Donnees en
      Sante Publique search engine. Studies written in English measuring burnout with
      the MBI tool among a population of practicing European physicians were selected. 
      Data were extracted and classified according to burnout's definition provided by 
      the authors. Three definitions using the MBI dimensions were considered: tri-,
      bi- and unidimensional definition. A meta-analysis was then performed on burnout 
      prevalence rates according to the dimensional definition of burnout. RESULTS:
      From 2378 search results, we selected 56 studies including from up to 41 European
      countries. Depending upon the study, physicians' burnout prevalence rates ranged 
      from 2.5% to 72.0%. The pooled prevalence rate of burnout was estimated at 7.7%
      [5.3-10.4%] with the tridimensional definition, 19.7% [13.5-26.3%] with the
      bidimensional definition and 43.2% [29.0-57.6%] with the unidimensional
      definition. CONCLUSION: Burnout pooled prevalence among physicians varies from
      single to fivefold depending on the method employed to assess burnout with the
      MBI tool. Medical community should determine a standardized method to assess
      burnout prevalence rates to best evaluate this phenomenon.

AB  - In human conversations, the emergence of new topics is a key factor in enabling
      dialogues to last longer. Additional information brought by new topics can make
      the conversation more diverse and interesting. Chat-bots also need to be equipped
      with this ability to proactively elicit new chatting topics. However, previous
      studies have neglected the elicitation of new topics in open-domain
      conversations. At the same time, previous works have represented topics with
      word-level keywords or entities. However, a topic is open to multiple keywords
      and a keyword can reflect multiple potential topics. To move towards a
      fine-grained topic representation, we represent topic with topically related
      words. In this paper, we design a novel model, named CMTE, which focuses not only
      on coherence with context, but also brings up new chatting topics. In order to
      extract topic information from conversational utterances, a Topic Fetcher module 
      is designed to fetch semantic-coherent topics with the help of topic model. To
      equip model with the ability to elicit new topics, a Topic Manager module is
      designed to associate the new topic with context. Finally, responses are
      generated by a well-designed fusion decoding mechanism to explicitly distinguish 
      between topic words and general words. Experiment results show that our model is 
      better than state of the art in automatic metrics and manual evaluations.

TI  - A meta-analysis of prognostic biomarkers in neonatal retinal hemorrhage.
LID - 10.1007/s10792-021-02055-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Neonatal retinal hemorrhage (RH) is a frequently occurring neonatal
      fundus condition and a very common ocular abnormality in neonates. Some of the
      key factors that influence the rate of RH are the mode of delivery, examination
      techniques, and time of examination after birth. The prognostic markers of severe
      RH are poorly known, making it difficult for an efficient diagnosis, prognosis,
      and treatment. Hence, to better understand the mechanism of disease, its study at
      the molecular level is required. Prognostic biomarkers are an essential tool for 
      understanding the pathogenesis of the disease. In this paper, we present a
      meta-analysis of biomarkers to understand disease pathogenesis and support better
      diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of neonatal RH. METHODS: The meta-analysis
      was carried out by following the recommendation of PRISMA. The relevant articles 
      were crawled using a systematic keyword using MeSH terms from the MEDLINE,
      PubMed, and Scopus databases, which were subjected to manual screening for
      reported biomarkers by two independent reviewers. The obtained biomarkers were
      further analyzed for gene-disease association and functional enrichment analysis.
      RESULTS: Our meta-analysis suggests that genes ABCC6, Beta-APP, COL2A1, COL4A1,
      DNM2, ENPP1, IKBKG, ITGB2, IL-6, SELE, TREX1, and VEGFA are potential prognostic 
      biomarkers associated with the neonatal RH. The gene-disease association and
      functional enrichment analysis suggest that few genes are associated with disease
      class "Vision"; however, some genes in the list are associated with the disease
      class "Pharmacogenomic," "Immune," "Renal." CONCLUSION: The identified prognostic
      gene biomarkers may help to understand disease pathogenesis and provide a better 
      diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of neonatal RH.

TI  - Adaptation and Assessment of a Text Messaging Smoking Cessation Intervention in
      Vietnam: Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - e27478
LID - 10.2196/27478 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Text message (ie, short message service, SMS) smoking cessation
      interventions have demonstrated efficacy in high-income countries but are less
      well studied in low- and middle-income countries, including Vietnam. OBJECTIVE:
      The goal of the research is to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and
      preliminary efficacy of a fully automated bidirectional SMS cessation
      intervention adapted for Vietnamese smokers. METHODS: The study was conducted in 
      3 phases. In phase 1, we adapted the SMS library from US-based SMS cessation
      programs (ie, SmokefreeTXT and Text2Quit). The adaptation process consisted of 7 
      focus groups with 58 smokers to provide data on culturally relevant patterns of
      tobacco use and assess message preferences. In phase 2, we conducted a single-arm
      pilot test of the SMS intervention with 40 smokers followed by in-depth
      interviews with 10 participants to inform additional changes to the SMS library. 
      In phase 3, we conducted a 2-arm pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 100
      smokers. Participants received either the SMS program (intervention; n=50) or
      weekly text assessment on smoking status (control; n=50). The 6-week SMS program 
      consisted of a 2-week prequit period and a 4-week postquit period. Participants
      received 2 to 4 automated messages per day. The main outcomes were engagement and
      acceptability which were assessed at 6 weeks (end of intervention). We assessed
      biochemically confirmed smoking abstinence at 6 weeks and 12 weeks.
      Postintervention in-depth interviews explored user experiences among a random
      sample of 16 participants in the intervention arm. RESULTS: Participants in both 
      arms reported high levels of engagement and acceptability. Participants reported 
      using the program for an average of 36.4 (SD 3.4) days for the intervention arm
      and 36.0 (SD 3.9) days for the control arm. Four of the 50 participants in the
      intervention arm (8%) reset the quit date and 19 (38%) texted the keyword TIPS.
      The majority of participants in both arms reported that they always or usually
      read the text messages. Compared to the control arm, a higher proportion of
      participants in the intervention arm reported being satisfied with the program
      (98% [49/50] vs 82% [41/50]). Biochemically verified abstinence was higher in the
      intervention arm at 6 weeks (20% [10/50] vs 2% [1/50]; P=.01), but the effect was
      not significant at 12 weeks (12% [6/50] vs 6% [3/50]; P=.49). In-depth interviews
      conducted after the RCT suggested additional modifications to enhance the program
      including tailoring the timing of messages, adding more opportunities to interact
      with the program, and placing a greater emphasis on messages that described the
      harms of smoking. CONCLUSIONS: The study supported the feasibility and
      acceptability of an SMS program adapted for Vietnamese smokers. Future studies
      need to assess whether, with additional modifications, the program is associated 
      with prolonged abstinence. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03219541;

TI  - Categorizing Vaccine Confidence With a Transformer-Based Machine Learning Model: 
      Analysis of Nuances of Vaccine Sentiment in Twitter Discourse.
PG  - e29584
LID - 10.2196/29584 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Social media has become an established platform for individuals to
      discuss and debate various subjects, including vaccination. With growing
      conversations on the web and less than desired maternal vaccination uptake rates,
      these conversations could provide useful insights to inform future interventions.
      However, owing to the volume of web-based posts, manual annotation and analysis
      are difficult and time consuming. Automated processes for this type of analysis, 
      such as natural language processing, have faced challenges in extracting complex 
      stances such as attitudes toward vaccination from large amounts of text.
      OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to build upon recent advances in
      transposer-based machine learning methods and test whether transformer-based
      machine learning could be used as a tool to assess the stance expressed in social
      media posts toward vaccination during pregnancy. METHODS: A total of 16,604
      tweets posted between November 1, 2018, and April 30, 2019, were selected using
      keyword searches related to maternal vaccination. After excluding irrelevant
      tweets, the remaining tweets were coded by 3 individual researchers into the
      categories Promotional, Discouraging, Ambiguous, and Neutral or No Stance. After 
      creating a final data set of 2722 unique tweets, multiple machine learning
      techniques were trained on a part of this data set and then tested and compared
      with the human annotators. RESULTS: We found the accuracy of the machine learning
      techniques to be 81.8% (F score=0.78) compared with the agreed score among the 3 
      annotators. For comparison, the accuracies of the individual annotators compared 
      with the final score were 83.3%, 77.9%, and 77.5%. CONCLUSIONS: This study
      demonstrates that we are able to achieve close to the same accuracy in
      categorizing tweets using our machine learning models as could be expected from a
      single human coder. The potential to use this automated process, which is
      reliable and accurate, could free valuable time and resources for conducting this
      analysis, in addition to informing potentially effective and necessary
      interventions.

TI  - News coverage of drug development: implications for the conveyance of health
      information.
PG  - 1799
LID - 10.1186/s12889-021-11849-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Technical information regarding health-related advances is sometimes 
      esoteric for the general public. News media, therefore, plays a key role in
      public health promotion via health information conveyance. In this study, we use 
      China as a sample country and analyze the claims and frames in news coverage of
      health-related advances, with special focus on news coverage of the development
      and performance of newly developed or tested drugs. METHODS: A keyword search was
      performed to retrieve news articles from four representative news agencies in
      China. In total, 3029 news reports were retrieved, of which 128 were selected for
      further analysis. RESULTS: Four aspects of news coverage of drug development were
      identified: (1) the characteristics of new drugs covered, (2) the sources of
      information, (3) the accuracy of health information in newspapers, and (4)
      textual features of news coverage. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal that
      guidelines should be established to facilitate more systematic news reporting on 
      health-related advances. Additionally, literacy among the general public and
      professionalism in health information conveyance should be promoted to negate the
      "illusion of knowing" about health-related advances.

TI  - Contribution of epididymal epithelial cell functions to sperm epigenetic changes 
      and the health of progeny.
PG  - 51-66
LID - 10.1093/humupd/dmab029 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spermatozoa acquire their motility and fertilizing abilities during
      their maturation through the epididymis. This process is controlled by epididymal
      epithelial cells that possess features adapted to sense and respond to their
      surrounding environment and to communicate with spermatozoa. During the past
      decade, new intercellular communication processes have been discovered, including
      the secretion and transport of molecules from the epithelium to spermatozoa via
      extracellular vesicles (EVs), as well as sensing of the intraluminal milieu by
      cellular extensions. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: This review addresses recent
      findings regarding epididymal epithelial cell features and interactions between
      spermatozoa and the epididymal epithelium as well as epigenetic modifications
      undergone by spermatozoa during transit through the epididymal microenvironment. 
      SEARCH METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in Pubmed with the keyword
      'epididymis'. Results were filtered on original research articles published from 
      2009 to 2021 and written in the English language. One hundred fifteen original
      articles presenting recent advancements on the epididymis contribution to sperm
      maturation were selected. Some additional papers cited in the primary reference
      were also included. A special focus was given to higher mammalian species,
      particularly rodents, bovines and humans, that are the most studied in this
      field. OUTCOMES: This review provides novel insights into the contribution of
      epididymal epithelium and EVs to post-testicular sperm maturation. First, new
      immune cell populations have been described in the epididymis, where they are
      proposed to play a role in protecting the environment surrounding sperm against
      infections or autoimmune responses. Second, novel epididymal cell extensions,
      including dendrites, axopodia and primary cilia, have been identified as sensors 
      of the environment surrounding sperm. Third, new functions have been outlined for
      epididymal EVs, which modify the sperm epigenetic profile and participate in
      transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of paternal traits. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: 
      Although the majority of these findings result from studies in rodents, this
      fundamental research will ultimately improve our knowledge of human reproductive 
      physiopathologies. Recent discoveries linking sperm epigenetic modifications with
      paternal environmental exposure and progeny outcome further stress the importance
      of advancing fundamental research on the epididymis. From this, new therapeutic
      options for infertile couples and better counseling strategies may arise to
      increase positive health outcomes in children conceived either naturally or with 
      ART.

TI  - Economic evaluations of videoconference and telephone consultations in primary
      care: A systematic review.
PG  - 1357633X211043380
LID - 10.1177/1357633X211043380 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Telehealth services using videoconference and telephone modalities 
      have been increasing exponentially in primary care since the coronavirus
      pandemic. The challenge now is ensuring that these services remain sustainable.
      This review investigates the cost-effectiveness of videoconference and telephone 
      consultations in primary care settings, by summarizing the available published
      evidence. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and CINAHL
      databases was used to identify articles published from January 2000 to July 2020,
      using keyword synonyms for telehealth, primary care, and economic evaluation.
      Databases were searched, and title, abstract, and full-text reviews were
      conducted. Article reporting quality was assessed using the Consolidated Health
      Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards checklist. RESULTS: Twenty articles were 
      selected for inclusion, with 12 describing telephone triage services, seven
      describing telehealth substitution services, and one describing another
      telehealth service in primary care. These services were delivered by nurses,
      doctors, and allied health clinicians. Of the 20 included studies, 11 used cost
      analyses, five used cost-minimization analyses, and four used one or more
      methods, including either a cost-consequence analysis, a cost-utility analysis,
      or a cost-effectiveness analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Telephone and videoconference
      consultations in primary care were cost-effective to the health system when
      deemed clinically appropriate, clinician when time was used efficiently, and when
      overall demand on health services was reduced. The societal benefits of
      telehealth consultations should be considered an important part of telehealth
      planning and should influence funding reform decisions for telehealth services in
      primary care.

AB  - The emergence of e-books with the characteristics of easy access and reading any 
      time anywhere is a subject of debate in academia. Topics include the use of
      e-books in libraries, their use in support teaching, new possibilities for
      reading activities, potential uses for library archives, and the motivation and
      intention of e-book users. Students at Guilin University of Technology
      participated in a survey. Of the 300 copies of the questionnaire distributed, 263
      valid copies were returned, a retrieval rate of 88%. The research results show
      that (1) Usability and reading need are the key factors in e-book usage.
      Usability refers to convenient keyword searches, portability, and any time
      reading. E-books are considered to make searching and reading large amounts of
      data easier. (2) E-books are not restricted to time and space so that the overall
      reading quantity is increasing. Readers become accustomed to reading e-books, and
      the quality of their digital reading is gradually enhanced. (3) Students should
      complete e-book use courses offered by libraries to enhance their familiarity
      with e-books and their use of e-book software, thereby enhancing postgraduate
      student readers' e-book information literacy. The results of the research prompt 
      suggestions to enhance the promotion of reading and e-book information to
      encourage student readers' e-book reading intention.

      tree with medicinal value.
PG  - 452
LID - 10.1186/s12870-021-03232-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chinese bayberry (Myrica rubra Sieb. & Zucc.) is an important fruit
      tree in China, and has high medicinal value. At present, the genome,
      transcriptome and germplasm resources of bayberry have been reported. In order to
      make more convenient use of these data, the Bayberry Database was established.
      RESULTS: The Bayberry Database is a comprehensive and intuitive data platform for
      examining the diverse annotated genome and germplasm resources of this species.
      This database contains nine central functional domains to interact with multiomic
      data: home, genome, germplasm, markers, tools, map, expression, reference, and
      contact. All domains provide pathways to a variety of data types composed of a
      reference genome sequence, transcriptomic data, gene patterns, phenotypic data,
      fruit images of Myrica rubra varieties, gSSR data, gene maps with annotation and 
      evolutionary analyses. The tools module includes BLAST search, keyword search,
      sequence fetch and enrichment analysis functions. CONCLUSIONS: The web address of
      the database is as follows http://www.bayberrybase.cn/ . The Myrica rubra
      database is an intelligent, interactive, and user-friendly system that enables
      researchers, breeders and horticultural personnel to browse, search and retrieve 
      relevant and useful information and thus facilitate genomic research and breeding
      efforts concerning Myrica rubra. This database will be of great help to bayberry 
      research and breeding in the future.

TI  - A dedifferentiated rare primary breast liposarcoma - case report and literature
      review.
PG  - 301-307
LID - 10.47162/RJME.62.1.33 [doi]
AB  - Liposarcoma of the breast is a very rare soft tissue malignant tumor arising in
      the fat cells, with a prevalence of 0.3% of all malignant breast tumors,
      clinically manifested as a palpable breast mass mimicking a primary breast
      cancer. In the present paper, we had two objectives: (i) to report the first
      liposarcoma case in our Clinic and (ii) to screen the scientific literature on
      the topic. Our report presents an unusual case of a 56-year-old female with
      symptomatic left breast mass initially histopathologically diagnosed as a
      mesenchymal lesion. Four months later, the tumor was histopathologically
      identified as a grade 3 dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLPS) Federation Nationale
      des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer (FNCLCC; French Federation of Cancer
      Centers). We present the histopathological, immunohistochemical, and radiological
      features of the case and outcomes. Secondly, we performed a systematic search on 
      liposarcoma on the PubMed(R)Medline(R) and Web of Science(R) databases, using the
      keyword "primary breast liposarcoma" (all-time topic). Due to the small number of
      cases found in the literature, the best treatment choice and determination of
      prognosis are difficult to make. Our patient underwent breast radical surgery,
      received adjuvant treatment, continuously monitored, being disease-free after
      five years of follow-up.

TI  - Bibliometric analysis of COVID-19 related publications in Indian orthopaedic
      journals.
PG  - 101608
LID - 10.1016/j.jcot.2021.101608 [doi]
AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an infodemic about the novel
      coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 outbreak to build knowledge and develop mitigation
      strategies. In addition, scientific journals across the world have studied the
      impact of COVID-19 on trauma and orthopaedics. Methods: A cross-sectional,
      bibliometric analysis of the literature was undertaken on COVID-19 related
      articles from three Pubmed and Scopus indexed orthopaedic journals from India,
      namely, Indian Journal of Orthopaedics(IJO),Journal of Clinical Orthopaedics and 
      Trauma(JCOT), and Journal of Orthopaedics (JOO), in May 2021. All the article
      types and study designs were included for this review. The authors, institutions,
      countries, keywords, and co-authorship mapping were studied. Results: A total of 
      112 COVID-19 related documents were retrieved. Period of these publications was
      from 2(nd) April 2020 to 31(st) May 2021. Vaishya R. (n = 16) was the most cited 
      author, and Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals (n = 16) was the most cited research
      Institution. India led the list of countries in academic publication output. On
      keyword mapping, telemedicine was the most prominent Medical Subject Headings
      (MeSH) search word. Conclusion: The Indian orthopedic journals have addressed the
      impact of COVID-19 on orthopaedic practice in India and aborad whilst continuing 
      to publish knowledge about basic science and clinical orthopaedic research
      studies. The JCOT has outperformed and become the most leading orthopaedic
      journal from India during the pandemic. COVID -19 articles have been fast
      tracked, open accessed and attracted more citations in reduced duration of time
      compared to non-COVID-19 papers.

TI  - Case Report: A Case of Infant Bronchial Dieulafoy's Disease and Article Review.
PG  - 674509
LID - 10.3389/fped.2021.674509 [doi]
AB  - Background: Bronchial Dieulafoy's disease (BDD), characterized by constant
      diameter arterial malformation, is rare, especially among infants. The
      pathogenesis and clinical features of pediatric patients are unknown.
      Misdiagnosis and biopsy operations may lead to potential massive hemorrhage,
      which endangers the patient's life. Case Presentation: Here, we present a case of
      a 9-month-old boy who was diagnosed with BDD with massive hemoptysis. The boy was
      cured by embolization of the bronchial artery and was in good health at the
      1-year follow-up. In addition, we searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of
      Science databases using keyword "Bronchial Dieulafoy's Disease (BDD)" and found
      six additional cases of pediatric BDD. Conclusion: It is still insufficient to
      draw a conclusion about the origin of the disease. Bronchial angiography and
      endobronchial ultrasonography are considered promising methods to diagnose
      Dieulafoy's disease of the bronchus. Bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy
      should not be deployed due to the high risk of fatal hemorrhage. Explicit
      clinical case reports of BDD are needed to enhance the understanding of this rare
      disease.

TI  - PDB-101: Educational resources supporting molecular explorations through biology 
      and medicine.
PG  - 129-140
LID - 10.1002/pro.4200 [doi]
AB  - The Protein Data Bank (PDB) archive is a rich source of information in the form
      of atomic-level three-dimensional (3D) structures of biomolecules experimentally 
      determined using macromolecular crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
      spectroscopy, and electron microscopy (3DEM). Originally established in 1971 as a
      resource for protein crystallographers to freely exchange data, today PDB data
      drive research and education across scientific disciplines. In 2011, the online
      portal PDB-101 was launched to support teachers, students, and the general public
      in PDB archive exploration (pdb101.rcsb.org). Maintained by the Research
      Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics PDB, PDB-101 aims to help train the
      next generation of PDB users and to promote the overall importance of structural 
      biology and protein science to nonexperts. Regularly published features include
      the highly popular Molecule of the Month series, 3D model activities, molecular
      animation videos, and educational curricula. Materials are organized into various
      categories (Health and Disease, Molecules of Life, Biotech and Nanotech, and
      Structures and Structure Determination) and searchable by keyword. A biennial
      health focus frames new resource creation and provides topics for annual video
      challenges for high school students. Web analytics document that PDB-101
      materials relating to fundamental topics (e.g., hemoglobin, catalase) are highly 
      accessed year-on-year. In addition, PDB-101 materials created in response to
      topical health matters (e.g., Zika, measles, coronavirus) are well received.
      PDB-101 shows how learning about the diverse shapes and functions of PDB
      structures promotes understanding of all aspects of biology, from the central
      dogma of biology to health and disease to biological energy.

TI  - On the behaviour of zirconia-based dental materials: A review.
PG  - 104861

AB  - Zirconia-based dental materials are extensively used in clinical practice due to 
      their tooth-like appearance, biofunctionality, biocompatibility, and
      affordability. However, premature clinical failures of veneering porcelains raise
      a concern about their integrity. Extensive studies have been performed over a
      decade to resolve this issue, but it is challenging to reference all information 
      effectively. A single source identifying the significance of potential parameters
      on material performance has not previously been available. An evidence-based
      meta-narrative review technique was used to review the characteristic parameters 
      that can affect the overall behaviour of zirconia-based materials. Keywords were 
      chosen to assess manuscripts based on scientific coherence with this paper's
      research objective. Online keyword searches were carried out on ScienceDirect,
      PubMed, and SAGE databases for relevant published manuscripts from year
      1985-2020.261 out of 3170 identified manuscripts were included. A total of 10
      parameters were identified and classified into the material, manufacturing, and
      geometric aspects. The effect of every parameter was reviewed on the performance 
      of the material. A discrepancy in findings was observed and is attributed to the 
      fact that there is no standard methodology. This review acts as a single source
      that summarizes various parameters' contribution to zirconia-based dental
      materials' performance. This review facilitates manufacturing improvements by
      accounting for every parameter's effect on overall performance.

TI  - Bibliometric analysis of immigration and environmental degradation: evidence from
      past decades.
PG  - 13729-13741
LID - 10.1007/s11356-021-16470-1 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this paper is to examine immigration and environmental degradation
      using bibliometric analysis. This paper also analyzes sources of publication,
      authorship, citations, distributions publications and other bibliometric
      indicators. The study focuses on a total of 1372 articles published from 2000 to 
      2020. These articles were collected through an automated process from the Scopus 
      database and later analyzed using techniques such as bibliometric indicators
      analysis, VOSviewer, and Perish or Publish. The research identified 991 articles 
      from varieties of published sources. The topic of immigrants and environmental
      degradation has been an emerging topic since 1981. Starting in 2000, most of the 
      scholars actively producing an articles pertinent to this topic. Most of the
      articles were published in journals, and English is the primary language of
      research. United States is the leading country in contributing the publications. 
      Meanwhile, the most significant fields in which the sources were produced were
      environmental science, agricultural and biological sciences, arts and humanities 
      and earth and planetary sciences. However, some limitations has been found. It
      has been suggested for future research, to lengthen this work to other databases,
      as well as bibliometric analyses of immigration and environmental degradation in 
      developed and developing countries by adding a new keyword such as energy
      consumption and climate change. This paper aims to assess recent trends in the
      expansion of academic literature on immigration and environmental degradation
      using the bibliometric analysis method. Network visualization and bibliometric
      indicators are used in this paper to present the results.

TI  - What Will It Mean for Me? Perceptions of the ECFMG 2023 Accreditation Requirement
      from an Online Forum.
PG  - 49-56
LID - 10.30770/2572-1852-107.2.49 [doi]
AB  - In 2010, the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG)
      announced that as of 2023, physicians applying to train and practice in the
      United States will be required to graduate from a medical school that has been
      accredited using criteria such as those developed by the World Federation for
      Medical Education. This study analyzed posts on the Student Doctor Network (SDN) 
      online forum that refer to this accreditation requirement to investigate how it
      has been perceived and understood by current and prospective medical students. A 
      keyword search of relevant terms was used to identify posts discussing the
      accreditation requirement on the SDN online forum, which were subjected to
      thematic analysis. There were a total of 83 posts from 49 distinct user accounts 
      between May 2012 and January 2020. Seven themes were identified in total; four
      whose overall purpose was to seek or offer advice and three whose overall purpose
      was commentary. Themes relating to advice included applications and admissions,
      future career planning, personal circumstances, and countryspecific issues.
      Themes relating to commentary included the accreditation requirement policy
      itself, the potential implications of the requirement, and the educational
      quality of non-U.S. medical schools. Only half of web links on these posts were
      to the ECFMG website for official information about the requirement. Although a
      variety of different perspectives about the ECFMG accreditation requirement were 
      expressed on an online forum for student doctors, the overall number of posts was
      low, which suggests that the requirement has not been a frequent topic of
      discussion on this platform. The insights gained from posts suggest personal
      opinions about the requirement and consequences for individual student
      application and career choices were the main areas of interest. Signposting to
      official information channels may help to raise awareness about the requirement
      and tackle areas of uncertainty and confusion about its implementation.

TI  - Classifying domain-specific text documents containing ambiguous keywords.
LID - baab062 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/database/baab062 [doi]
AB  - A keyword-based search of comprehensive databases such as PubMed may return
      irrelevant papers, especially if the keywords are used in multiple fields of
      study. In such cases, domain experts (curators) need to verify the results and
      remove the irrelevant articles. Automating this filtering process will save time,
      but it has to be done well enough to ensure few relevant papers are rejected and 
      few irrelevant papers are accepted. A good solution would be fast, work with the 
      limited amount of data freely available (full paper body may be missing), handle 
      ambiguous keywords and be as domain-neutral as possible. In this paper, we
      evaluate a number of classification algorithms for identifying a domain-specific 
      set of papers about echinoderm species and show that the resulting tool satisfies
      most of the abovementioned requirements. Echinoderms consist of a number of very 
      different organisms, including brittle stars, sea stars (starfish), sea urchins
      and sea cucumbers. While their taxonomic identifiers are specific, the common
      names are used in many other contexts, creating ambiguity and making a keyword
      search prone to error. We try classifiers using Linear, Naive Bayes, Nearest
      Neighbor, Tree, SVM, Bagging, AdaBoost and Neural Network learning models and
      compare their performance. We show how effective the resulting classifiers are in
      filtering irrelevant articles returned from PubMed. The methodology used is more 
      dependent on the good selection of training data and is a practical solution that
      can be applied to other fields of study facing similar challenges. Database URL:

TI  - YouTube as a Source of Information on Echocardiography: Content and Quality
      Analysis.
PG  - 534-541
LID - 10.6515/ACS.202109_37(5).20210514A [doi]
AB  - Background: YouTube (YouTube, LLC, San Bruno, CA, USA) is an easily accessible
      and increasingly popular source of information on health-related issues. This
      study evaluated the scientific content and quality of English-language
      echocardiography videos posted to this Internet platform. Methods: For this
      study, 583 videos were identified and evaluated following a YouTube search using 
      the keyword 'echocardiography' in July 2020. A total of 92 videos were included
      in this study following the application of the study exclusion criteria. Both
      video quality and scientific content were evaluated based on the DISCERN score,
      global quality score, content score, and total quality score (TQS), which was
      calculated by adding the scores of the three aforementioned scoring systems.
      Results: The median duration of the included videos was 315 seconds
      (interquartile range: 173-852 seconds). The median number of views was 33046
      (interquartile range: 7445-89012). Twenty-four (26.08%), 43 (46.73%) and 25
      (27.17%) videos, respectively, were stratified into the following three groups
      based on TQS values: group 1 (5-7 points), group 2 (8-11 points) and group 3
      (12-14 points). The values of views (median: 45072), video duration (median:
      474), power index (median: 80250) and popularity (median: 34) were significantly 
      higher in group 3 than in the other groups. The duration that a video was online 
      was statistically significantly higher in group 1. Conclusions: The results
      suggest that YouTube is an important tool for easily sharing health-related
      information and disseminating it to large audiences. It can be concluded from the
      growing interest in videos with scientific content and the high quality scores
      recorded that YouTube offers accurate and quality information about
      echocardiography.

TI  - Definition of character for medical education based on expert opinions in Korea.
PG  - 26
LID - 10.3352/jeehp.2021.18.26 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This follow-up study focused on 3 overarching questions: what keywords
      can be extracted from experts' definitions of character?; what is the operational
      definition of character for medical students?; and what possible solutions can be
      suggested to address the issues of character education that were identified in
      the previous study? METHODS: Sixty-three medical education experts recruited
      through expert sampling and 19 non-medical education experts recruited through
      snowball sampling answered a questionnaire that addressed the 3 major questions
      of the study. The responses were analyzed for descriptive statistics with
      supplementary keyword extraction tools, including the Cortical and Monkey keyword
      extractors. RESULTS: A total of 93 definitional statements were counted, and 138 
      keyword terms were extracted. The top 5 keyword terms mentioned by the medical
      education experts were "patient", "empathy", "qualities", "attitude", and
      "ability". These keyword terms were quite different from those mentioned by the
      non-medical education experts. Based on the extracted keywords, an operational
      definition of character education by the medical education expert group was
      presented as follows: the basic qualities and ability to empathize with patients 
      affected by illness based on respect for patients and others. Various methods
      were proposed to solve the issue of character education, and many of them pointed
      to curriculum development, such as improvements in teaching and learning methods 
      and evaluation methods, including role modeling. CONCLUSION: A clear statement of
      the concept of character education is the start to resolve issues of character
      education. Character education improvements will be possible at the institutional
      level according to the above results.

TI  - 'Joining the Dots': Individual, Sociocultural and Environmental Links between
      Alcohol Consumption, Dietary Intake and Body Weight-A Narrative Review.
LID - 2927 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu13092927 [doi]
AB  - Alcohol is energy-dense, elicits weak satiety responses relative to solid food,
      inhibits dietary fat oxidation, and may stimulate food intake. It has, therefore,
      been proposed as a contributor to weight gain and obesity. The aim of this
      narrative review was to consolidate and critically appraise the evidence on the
      relationship of alcohol consumption with dietary intake and body weight, within
      mainstream (non-treatment) populations. Publications were identified from a
      PubMed keyword search using the terms 'alcohol', 'food', 'eating', 'weight',
      'body mass index', 'obesity', 'food reward', 'inhibition', 'attentional bias',
      'appetite', 'culture', 'social'. A snowball method and citation searches were
      used to identify additional relevant publications. Reference lists of relevant
      publications were also consulted. While limited by statistical heterogeneity,
      pooled results of experimental studies showed a relatively robust association
      between acute alcohol intake and greater food and total energy intake. This
      appears to occur via metabolic and psychological mechanisms that have not yet
      been fully elucidated. Evidence on the relationship between alcohol intake and
      weight is equivocal. Most evidence was derived from cross-sectional survey data
      which does not allow for a cause-effect relationship to be established.
      Observational research evidence was limited by heterogeneity and methodological
      issues, reducing the certainty of the evidence. We found very little qualitative 
      work regarding the social, cultural, and environmental links between concurrent
      alcohol intake and eating behaviours. That the evidence of alcohol intake and
      body weight remains uncertain despite no shortage of research over the years,
      indicates that more innovative research methodologies and nuanced analyses are
      needed to capture what is clearly a complex and dynamic relationship. Also, given
      synergies between 'Big Food' and 'Big Alcohol' industries, effective policy
      solutions are likely to overlap and a unified approach to policy change may be
      more effective than isolated efforts. However, joint action may not occur until
      stronger evidence on the relationship between alcohol intake, food intake and
      weight is established.

TI  - Making Radiomics More Reproducible across Scanner and Imaging Protocol
      Variations: A Review of Harmonization Methods.
LID - 842 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jpm11090842 [doi]
AB  - Radiomics converts medical images into mineable data via a high-throughput
      extraction of quantitative features used for clinical decision support. However, 
      these radiomic features are susceptible to variation across scanners, acquisition
      protocols, and reconstruction settings. Various investigations have assessed the 
      reproducibility and validation of radiomic features across these discrepancies.
      In this narrative review, we combine systematic keyword searches with prior
      domain knowledge to discuss various harmonization solutions to make the radiomic 
      features more reproducible across various scanners and protocol settings.
      Different harmonization solutions are discussed and divided into two main
      categories: image domain and feature domain. The image domain category comprises 
      methods such as the standardization of image acquisition, post-processing of raw 
      sensor-level image data, data augmentation techniques, and style transfer. The
      feature domain category consists of methods such as the identification of
      reproducible features and normalization techniques such as statistical
      normalization, intensity harmonization, ComBat and its derivatives, and
      normalization using deep learning. We also reflect upon the importance of deep
      learning solutions for addressing variability across multi-centric radiomic
      studies especially using generative adversarial networks (GANs), neural style
      transfer (NST) techniques, or a combination of both. We cover a broader range of 
      methods especially GANs and NST methods in more detail than previous reviews.

TI  - Research on the Influencing Factors of Audience Popularity Level of COVID-19
      Videos during the COVID-19 Pandemic.
LID - 1159 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/healthcare9091159 [doi]
AB  - (1) Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, users share and obtain COVID-19
      information through video platforms, but only a few COVID-19 videos become
      popular among most audiences. Therefore, it is a very interesting and important
      research question to explore the influencing factors of the popularity of
      COVID-19 videos during the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) Our research collects video
      data related to the keyword "COVID-19" on video platform, the data are analyzed
      by content analysis and empirical analysis. We then constructed a theoretical
      model based on the information adoption model; (3) A total of 251 videos were
      divided into three categories. The least common category was the data and
      analysis category (11.2%), followed by the prevention and control status category
      (13.5%); the knowledge and general science category was the most common (75.3%). 
      From the perspective of video quality, the information sources of most videos are
      relatively reliable, and the content of medical information is low. The research 
      results showed that short video lengths, longer descriptions, more reliable video
      sources and lower medical information content were more popular with audiences.
      Audiences are more likely to be attracted to videos in the prevention and control
      status category and knowledge and general science category. Videos uploaded by
      uploaders who have a higher influence are more popular with audiences; (4)
      Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic, information quality (video length,
      description length, video content type, and medical information and content
      index) and source credibility (information source reliability, influence and
      certification type) all significantly influence the popularity level of COVID-19 
      videos. Our research conclusions can provide management suggestions for the
      platform, make videos released by uploaders more popular with audiences, and help
      audiences better understand COVID-19 information and make prevention and control 
      efforts.

TI  - Determination of Motivating Factors of Urban Forest Visitors through Latent
      Dirichlet Allocation Topic Modeling.
LID - 9649 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18189649 [doi]
AB  - Despite the unique characteristics of urban forests, the motivating factors of
      urban forest visitors have not been clearly differentiated from other types of
      the forest resource. This study aims to identify the motivating factors of urban 
      forest visitors, using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling based on 
      social big data. A total of 57,449 cases of social text data from social blogs
      containing the keyword "urban forest" were collected from Naver and Daum, the
      major search engines in South Korea. Then, 17,229 cases were excluded using
      morpheme analysis and stop word elimination; 40,110 cases were analyzed to
      identify the motivating factors of urban forest visitors through LDA topic
      modeling. Seven motivating factors-"Cafe-related Walk", "Healing Trip", "Daily
      Leisure", "Family Trip", "Wonderful View", "Clean Space", and "Exhibition and
      Photography"-were extracted; each contained five keywords. This study elucidates 
      the role of forests as a place for healing, leisure, and daily exercise. The
      results suggest that efforts should be made toward developing various programs
      regarding the basic functionality of urban forests as a natural resource and a
      unique place to support a diversity of leisure and cultural activities.

TI  - Subjective Experiences of Mental Health Crisis Care in Emergency Departments: A
      Narrative Review of the Qualitative Literature.
LID - 9650 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18189650 [doi]
AB  - Mental health presentations to the emergency department (ED) have increased, and 
      the emergency department has become the initial contact point for people in a
      mental health crisis. However, there is mounting evidence that the ED is not
      appropriate nor effective in responding to people in mental health crises.
      Insufficient attention has been paid to the subjective experience of people
      seeking support during a mental health crisis. This review aims to describe the
      qualitative literature involving the subjective experiences of people presenting 
      to the ED during a mental health crisis. The method was guided by Arksey and
      O'Malley's framework for scoping studies and included keyword searches of
      PsycINFO, CINAHL, Medline and Embase. A narrative analysis, drawing on the visual
      tool of journey mapping, was applied to summarise the findings. Twenty-three
      studies were included. The findings represent the experience of accessing EDs,
      through to the impact of treatment. The review found points of opportunity that
      improve people's experiences and characteristics associated with negative
      experiences. The findings highlight the predominance and impact of negative
      experiences of the ED and the incongruence between the expectations of people
      presenting to the ED and the experience of treatment.

TI  - A Half Century of Research on Childhood and Adolescent Depression: Science
      Mapping the Literature, 1970 to 2019.
LID - 9524 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18189524 [doi]
AB  - In order to gain an in-depth understanding of research about childhood and
      adolescent depression, this article analyzes the scale, development, and
      geographic distribution of the literature in the field based on 8491 articles
      extracted from the Web of Science Core database. Using citation analysis, this
      article identifies influential journals, scholars, and documents in this field.
      The study found that in the past 15 years, the number of documents has increased 
      significantly and geographical diversity has also increased. Most of the highly
      influential literature relates to depression inventories. Using keyword
      co-occurrence analysis, this article also identified three key research topics
      focusing on (a) child and adolescent depression symptoms and prevalence, (b)
      parental depression and child behavioral or emotional problems, and (c) childhood
      abuse and depression. This study uses 'science mapping' as a means to provide a
      better understanding of research trends about childhood and adolescent depression
      that have emerged over the past half century, and may serve as reference for
      future research.

TI  - Finding the "Heart" in the Green: Conducting a Bibliometric Analysis to Emphasize
      the Need for Connecting Emotions with Biophilic Urban Planning.
LID - 9435 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18189435 [doi]
AB  - Although there is a robust body of literature exploring the relationship between 
      biophilic urban planning (BUP) and public health and well-being, there is a
      dearth of scholarship on the emotional components of BUP. It is crucial to
      understand these sentiment-related elements, so planners can assign "human value"
      to green spaces as a strategy for emphasizing the need to thoughtfully implement 
      and properly maintain them in urban environments. Furthermore, humans' emotional 
      experiences with green spaces may also reveal hidden or unexpected functions of
      those spaces. To confirm this lack of emphasis on emotions in BUP, we used Scopus
      to conduct a bibliometric analysis on relevant literature published within the
      last twenty years (2001-2021), ultimately collecting 589 relevant peer-reviewed
      articles. We then utilized VOSviewer (Centre for Science and Technology Studies, 
      Leiden University, The Netherlands) to visualize our results and identify
      thematic, geographic, authorship/co-authorship, publication, and temporal trends.
      "Green space" appeared as our most frequently occurring keyword and scholars
      affiliated with institutions located within the United States, the United Kingdom
      and China were the top producers of relevant results. Our authorship analysis
      resulted in 67 different clusters and three major but isolated networks. Urban
      Forestry and Urban Greening was the most prevalent source of publication and
      2019-2021 was the most prolific period of activity to date. While the goal of our
      review is to underscore the dearth of controlled, interdisciplinary research on
      the emotional components of BUP, we also uncovered additional key gaps in
      scholarship that could promote future avenues of inquiry. First, by focusing on
      the emotional value of green spaces, practitioners can ascribe them an intangible
      "human value" that could, in turn, generate more community-focused designs that
      provide access across socioeconomic, racial and age brackets. Second, an increase
      in scholarly representation from developing countries could help address the
      "human value" of green spaces not simply as a "first-world" phenomenon. Finally, 
      a global focus on the emotional, human connections to green spaces may help
      scholars and practitioners alike mitigate the growing trend of green
      gentrification.

TI  - Effects of Diesel, Heavy Metals and Plastics Pollution on Penguins in Antarctica:
      A Review.
LID - 2505 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani11092505 [doi]
AB  - Antarctica is a relatively pristine continent that attracts scientists and
      tourists alike. However, the risk of environmental pollution in Antarctica is
      increasing with the increase in the number of visitors. Recently, there has been 
      a surge in interest regarding diesel, heavy metals and microplastics pollution.
      Contamination from these pollutants poses risks to the environment and the health
      of organisms inhabiting the continent. Penguins are one of the most prominent and
      widely distributed animals in Antarctica and are at major risk due to pollution. 
      Even on a small scale, the impacts of pollution toward penguin populations are
      extensive. This review discusses the background of penguins in Antarctica, the
      anthropogenic pollution and cases, as well as the impacts of diesel, heavy metals
      and microplastics toxicities on penguins. The trends of the literature for the
      emerging risks of these pollutants are also reviewed through a bibliometric
      approach and network mapping analysis. A sum of 27 articles are analyzed on the
      effects of varying pollutants on penguins in Antarctica from 2000 to 2020 using
      the VOSviewer bibliometric software, Microsoft Excel and Tableau Public. Research
      articles collected from the Scopus database are evaluated for the most applicable
      research themes according to the bibliometric indicators (articles, geography
      distribution, annual production, integrated subject areas, key source journals
      and keyword or term interactions). Although bibliometric studies on the present
      research theme are not frequent, our results are sub-optimal due to the small
      number of search query matches from the Scopus database. As a result, our
      findings offer only a fragmentary comprehension of the topics in question.
      Nevertheless, this review provides valuable inputs regarding prospective research
      avenues for researchers to pursue in the future.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The main aim of this study was to describe and conduct a bibliometric 
      analysis of the state of research on stress, anxiety, and postpartum depression
      in mothers of preterm infants in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. BACKGROUND:
      Women affected by premature births are particularly exposed to mental health
      difficulties in the postpartum period. The desire to comprehend and the growing
      interest in research on stress, anxiety, and postpartum depression in mothers of 
      preterm infants in neonatal intensive care have led to a substantial rise in the 
      number of documents in this field over the last years. Thus, it makes it vital to
      regularly review the state of knowledge on this phenomenon in order to identify
      progress and constraints, to stimulate reflection, and to encourage progress in
      future research. METHOD: This study examined 366 articles published in the Scopus
      database (1976-2020). Keyword analysis was also used to identify hot research
      trends to be developed in future studies. This study complies with the PRISMA-Scr
      guidelines for quality improvement research in the EQUATOR network. RESULTS: Our 
      results reveal that research in this field is in a period of high production and 
      allows this flourishing body of work to be organized into different periods,
      highlighting the most important themes. In such a way, our research enriches the 
      lively field by presenting a comprehensive understanding of the field.
      DISCUSSION: The key contribution of this study is the development of a conceptual
      map of research on stress, anxiety, and postpartum depression in mothers of
      preterm infants in neonatal intensive care units.

TI  - Biologically-Inspired Pulse Signal Processing for Intelligence at the Edge.
PG  - 568384
LID - 10.3389/frai.2021.568384 [doi]
AB  - There is an ever-growing mismatch between the proliferation of data-intensive,
      power-hungry deep learning solutions in the machine learning (ML) community and
      the need for agile, portable solutions in resource-constrained devices,
      particularly for intelligence at the edge. In this paper, we present a
      fundamentally novel approach that leverages data-driven intelligence with
      biologically-inspired efficiency. The proposed Sparse Embodiment
      Neural-Statistical Architecture (SENSA) decomposes the learning task into two
      distinct phases: a training phase and a hardware embedment phase where prototypes
      are extracted from the trained network and used to construct fast, sparse
      embodiment for hardware deployment at the edge. Specifically, we propose the
      Sparse Pulse Automata via Reproducing Kernel (SPARK) method, which first
      constructs a learning machine in the form of a dynamical system using
      energy-efficient spike or pulse trains, commonly used in neuroscience and
      neuromorphic engineering, then extracts a rule-based solution in the form of
      automata or lookup tables for rapid deployment in edge computing platforms. We
      propose to use the theoretically-grounded unifying framework of the Reproducing
      Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) to provide interpretable, nonlinear, and
      nonparametric solutions, compared to the typical neural network approach. In
      kernel methods, the explicit representation of the data is of secondary nature,
      allowing the same algorithm to be used for different data types without altering 
      the learning rules. To showcase SPARK's capabilities, we carried out the first
      proof-of-concept demonstration on the task of isolated-word automatic speech
      recognition (ASR) or keyword spotting, benchmarked on the TI-46 digit corpus.
      Together, these energy-efficient and resource-conscious techniques will bring
      advanced machine learning solutions closer to the edge.

LID - 10.2174/1386207325666210924104036 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria is responsible for a social and an economic burden in most
      low-income malaria-affected countries. Thus, newer antimalarials are needed to
      tackle morbidities and mortalities associated with the drug-resistant malarial
      strains. Haemoglobin digestion inside the food vacuole of malarial parasite would
      lead to producing redox-active and toxic-free heme. The detoxification process
      adopted by Plasmodium sp. would give rise to hemozoin (Hz) (beta-hematin)
      formation. Targeting the pathway of hemozoin formation is considered as a
      validated target for the discovery of newer antimalarials. OBJECTIVE: This study 
      aims to collect detailed information about aspects of hemozoin (Hz)
      (beta-hematin) inhibitors. METHODS: A systemic search has been carried out using 
      PubMed, Google Scholar, CNKI, etc., for relevant studies having the keyword, '
      hemozoin or beta-hematin' for almost the last 2 decades (2000-2021). RESULTS:
      This mini-review tries to summarize all the recent advancements made for the
      developments of synthetic, natural isolated phytoconstituents and plant extracts 
      inhibiting the hemozoin (beta-hematin) formation. CONCLUSION: thus, would act as 
      promising antimalarial candidates in near future.

      was performed using VOSviewer 1.6.15. RESULTS: In total, 1233 documents from 2020
      were retrieved, of which 680 were original articles. The United States
      contributed the largest publication output (285, 23.1%). Huazhong University of
      Science and Technology published the most articles in this field (35), while
      Wuhan University received the most citations (1149). The United Kingdom had the
      strongest collaboration network. Four keyword clusters representing hotspots in
      this field were identified. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to developed countries,
      countries seriously affected by the COVID-19 pandemic also made significant
      contributions to mental health research during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study 
      focused on various aspects, such as mental health during isolation, mental health
      in healthcare workers, and public mental health issues during the COVID-19
      pandemic. In the future, countries should strengthen global cooperation and pay
      more attention to the mental health of vulnerable groups during pandemics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Quercetin is a natural flavonoid, which widely exists in nature, such
      as tea, coffee, apples, and onions. Numerous studies have showed that quercetin
      has multiple biological activities such as anti-oxidation, anti-inflammatory, and
      anti-aging. Hence, quercetin has a significant therapeutic effect on cancers,
      obesity, diabetes, and other diseases. In the past decades, a large number of
      studies have shown that quercetin combined with other agents can significantly
      improve the overall therapeutic effect, compared to single use. PURPOSE: This
      work reviews the pharmacological activities of quercetin and its derivatives. In 
      addition, this work also summarizes both in vivo and in vitro experimental
      evidence for the synergistic effect of quercetin against cancers and metabolic
      diseases. METHODS: An extensive systematic search for pharmacological activities 
      and synergistic effect of quercetin was performed considering all the relevant
      literatures published until August 2021 through the databases including NCBI
      PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The relevant literatures were
      extracted from the databases with following keyword combinations:
      "pharmacological activities" OR "biological activities" OR "synergistic effect"
      OR "combined" OR "combination" AND "quercetin" as well as free-text words.
      RESULTS: Quercetin and its derivatives possess multiple pharmacological
      activities including anti-cancer, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory,
      anti-cardiovascular, anti-aging, and neuroprotective activities. In addition, the
      synergistic effect of quercetin with small molecule agents against cancers and
      metabolic diseases has also been confirmed. CONCLUSION: Quercetin cooperates with
      agents to improve the therapeutic effect by regulating signal molecules and
      blocking cell cycle. Synergistic therapy can reduce the dose of agents and avoid 
      the possible toxic and side effects in the treatment process. Although quercetin 
      treatment has some potential side effects, it is safe under the expected use
      conditions. Hence, quercetin has application value and potential strength as a
      clinical drug. Furthermore, quercetin, as the main effective therapeutic
      ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine, may effectively treat and prevent
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

TI  - Clinical findings associated with N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide
      measurement in dogs and cats attending first opinion veterinary practices.
PG  - e945
LID - 10.1002/vetr.945 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical findings associated with N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic
      peptide (NT-proBNP) measurement in dogs and cats in primary practice, and their
      relevance to published measurement indications, have not been described. METHODS:
      Using electronic health record data collected by the Small Animal Veterinary
      Surveillance Network, appointments in which NT-proBNP was measured were
      identified using keyword-based text filtering. For these appointments, clinical
      findings were manually identified from each patient's clinical narrative (CN) and
      their frequencies described. RESULTS: CNs of 3510 appointments (357 dogs and 257 
      cats) from 99practices were evaluated. The most frequently recorded clinical
      findings in dogs were: heart murmur (n = 147, 41.2% (95% confidence interval (CI)
      = 36.1%-46.3%), coughing (n = 83, 23.2% (95% CI = 18.8%-27.6%)) and panting (n = 
      58, 16.2% (95% CI = 12.4%-20.0%)) and in cats: heart murmur (n = 143, 55.6% (95% 
      CI = 49.5%-61.7%)), suspected thromboembolism (n = 88, 34.2% (95% CI =
      28.4%-40.0%)) and weight loss (n = 53, 20.6% (95% CI = 15.7%-25.5%)). Dyspnoea
      and tachypnoea were infrequently reported in dogs (n = 29, 8.1% (95% CI =
      5.3%-10.9%) and n = 21, 5.9% (95% CI = 3.5%-8.3%), respectively) and cats (n =
      26, 10.1% (95% CI = 6.4%-13.8%) and n = 36, 14.0% (95% CI = 9.8%-18.2%),
      respectively). CONCLUSION: Clinical findings referable to cardiac disease were
      recorded contemporaneously with NT-proBNP measurement and suggested both
      published and other indications (coughing (in dogs and cats), and serial
      measurements and thromboembolism (in cats)) for testing.

TI  - Deep Multiple Instance Hashing for Fast Multi-Object Image Search.
PG  - 7995-8007
LID - 10.1109/TIP.2021.3112011 [doi]
AB  - Multi-keyword query is widely supported in text search engines. However, an
      analogue in image retrieval systems, multi-object query, is rarely studied.
      Meanwhile, traditional object-based image retrieval methods often involve
      multiple steps separately. In this work, we propose a weakly-supervised Deep
      Multiple Instance Hashing (DMIH) approach for multi-object image retrieval. Our
      DMIH approach, which leverages a popular CNN model to build the end-to-end
      relation between a raw image and the binary hash codes of its multiple objects,
      can support multi-object queries effectively and integrate object detection with 
      hashing learning seamlessly. We treat object detection as a binary multiple
      instance learning (MIL) problem and such instances are automatically extracted
      from multi-scale convolutional feature maps. We also design a conditional random 
      field (CRF) module to capture both the semantic and spatial relations among
      different class labels. For hashing training, we sample image pairs to learn
      their semantic relationships in terms of hash codes of the most probable
      proposals for owned labels as guided by object predictors. The two objectives
      benefit each other in a multi-task learning scheme. Finally, a two-level inverted
      index method is proposed to further speed up the retrieval of multi-object
      queries. Our DMIH approach outperforms state-of-the-arts on public benchmarks for
      object-based image retrieval and achieves promising results for multi-object
      queries.

PG  - 323-339
LID - 10.1080/2090598X.2021.1926753 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: To systematically review and discuss the current evidence from
      placebo-controlled clinical trials that investigated the use of alternative
      medicines and herbal remedies in the management of erectile dysfunction (ED).
      Methods: A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
      (PRISMA)-based systematic review using specific keyword combinations was
      conducted on the PubMed and Scopus databases. Randomised controlled trials
      investigating herbal medicine in at least one group and using the International
      Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) as an outcome in patients primarily diagnosed
      with ED were included for review. Results: Following the literature search,
      screening and eligibility analysis, a total of 42 articles were included. The 42 
      articles were categorised as single herb extractions (n = 14), combination herbal
      formula (n = 5), combination of herbal formula and non-herbal nutraceuticals (n =
      7), non-herbal nutraceuticals (n = 5), acupuncture and moxibustion (n = 2), diet 
      and nutrition (n = 3), exercise (n = 5), and topical treatments (n = 1). Based on
      the results, Korean ginseng, Pygnogenol and Prelox, Tribulus terrestris, Lepidium
      meyenii, L-arginine, acupuncture and lifestyle interventions were the more
      predominantly investigated treatments interventions for ED. Conclusions: Panax
      ginseng, Pygnogenol, Prelox and Tribulus terrestris have promising evidence as
      herbal products, alongside L-arginine as a nutritional supplement, for ED based
      on IIEF outcomes, and warrant further clinical investigation. The mechanisms of
      action remain unclear, but each of these appears to in part increase nitric oxide
      synthesis. Importantly, improved diet and exercise should be considered,
      particularly in patients with obesity or diabetes mellitus.

TI  - Voters' view of leaders during the Covid-19 crisis: Quantitative analysis of
      keyword descriptions provides strength and direction of evaluations.
LID - 10.1111/ssqu.13036 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: Previous research suggests that governments usually gain support
      during crises such as the Covid-19. However, these findings are based on rating
      scales that only allow us to measure the strength of this support. This article
      proposes a new measure of how voters evaluate Prime Ministers (PM) by asking for 
      descriptive keywords that are analyzed by natural language processing. Methods:
      By collecting a representative sample of citizens' own key words describing their
      PM in 15 countries in Europe during the outbreak of Covid-19, and analyzing these
      by latent semantic analysis and a multiple OLS regression, we could quantify the 
      strength and direction of voters' view. Results: The strength analysis supported 
      previous studies that describing the PM with positive words was strongly
      associated with vote intention. Furthermore, a change in the direction of the
      attitudes from "good" to "honest" was found. A new finding was that the pandemic 
      was associated with an increase in polarization. Conclusions: The keyword
      evaluation analysis provides opportunities of evaluating both strength and
      direction of voters' view of their PM, where we show new results related to
      increased polarization and shift in the direction of attitudes.

      with the broad spectrum of problems managed in primary care practice. The aim of 
      this study was to analyse publication trends concerning the burden of medical
      conditions reported in primary care journals, and to compare these findings with 
      the burden of problems seen in clinical practice, in order to identify research
      gaps. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Scientometric tools were used to analyse 9956
      articles of primary care journals indexed in MEDLINE. Through keyword analysis, a
      relations map was built. Literature review and a primary care database were used 
      to identify active problems and reasons for visiting a family physician. Rankings
      and frequencies of research output and conditions were compared. RESULTS: Keyword
      analysis identified five clusters of publication trends: cardiovascular
      conditions and conditions related with unhealthy lifestyles; mental disorders;
      infections; oncology and health management. By comparing publications with
      clinical problems, the fields of orthopaedics, endocrinology/metabolism,
      gastroenterology/hepatology, dermatology, ophthalmology, and the respiratory
      system show the biggest gaps. Through the relations map, more concrete potential 
      research topics were identified such as palliative care, chronic pain, insomnia, 
      antibiotic prescribing, burnout, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and COVID-19.
      DISCUSSION: The present study acknowledged potential research and publication
      gaps in Primary Care journals. The findings might help to direct continuing
      medical education and help with guideline development. CONCLUSION: The
      distribution of publications in primary care journals is distinct from the burden
      of problems faced in clinical practice and reasons for visiting a family
      physician. The use of scientometric tools to identify publication trends and
      their comparison with common problems could be a strategy to identify areas with 
      research gaps in primary care.

AB  - Information retrieval (IR) for precision medicine (PM) often involves looking for
      multiple pieces of evidence that characterize a patient case. This typically
      includes at least the name of a condition and a genetic variation that applies to
      the patient. Other factors such as demographic attributes, comorbidities, and
      social determinants may also be pertinent. As such, the retrieval problem is
      often formulated as ad hoc search but with multiple facets (e.g., disease,
      mutation) that may need to be incorporated. In this paper, we present a document 
      reranking approach that combines neural query-document matching and text
      summarization toward such retrieval scenarios. Our architecture builds on the
      basic BERT model with three specific components for reranking: (a).
      document-query matching (b). keyword extraction and (c). facet-conditioned
      abstractive summarization. The outcomes of (b) and (c) are used to essentially
      transform a candidate document into a concise summary that can be compared with
      the query at hand to compute a relevance score. Component (a) directly generates 
      a matching score of a candidate document for a query. The full architecture
      benefits from the complementary potential of document-query matching and the
      novel document transformation approach based on summarization along PM facets.
      Evaluations using NIST's TREC-PM track datasets (2017-2019) show that our model
      achieves state-of-the-art performance. To foster reproducibility, our code is

TI  - Skin-Lightening Products: Consumer Preferences and Costs.
PG  - e17245
LID - 10.7759/cureus.17245 [doi]
AB  - Disorders of skin hyperpigmentation have an appreciable impact on quality of
      life, carrying social and cultural importance that influences widespread consumer
      demand for cosmetic lightening products. We sought to investigate product factors
      that may influence consumer preference when choosing an over-the-counter cream
      for skin-lightening purposes. The keyword "lightening cream" was searched in the 
      "Beauty and Personal Care category" of online retailer Amazon.com. The top fifth 
      percentile of products was determined by filtering the search results for a
      minimum of four out of five stars from customer reviews, and then further
      filtered by products with over 100 reviews. Number of reviews, rating, price per 
      unit, vehicle, application instructions, ingredients, and review attributes were 
      evaluated. Over 2,900 products were catalogued as "lightening cream" on
      Amazon.com. There were 40 products rated >4 stars and >100 reviews, constituting 
      the top 1.34% of entries. Tocopheryl was present in 58% of the top 40 products,
      ascorbic acid in 40%, and niacinamide in 20%. Notably, 22.5% of the top 40
      products contained no known skin-lightening ingredient. There was a moderate
      positive correlation (R(2)=0.378) between price and consumer rating, with kojic
      acid being the most expensive per ounce ($24.89) and salicylic acid being the
      most highly rated (4.54 stars; $15.00/oz). This study provides insight on the
      factors influencing the choice, preferences, and satisfaction of consumer that
      sought Amazon for the purchase of lightening products.

TI  - Effectiveness of Stem Cell Therapies in Improving Clinical Outcomes in Patients
      With Heart Failure.
PG  - e17236
LID - 10.7759/cureus.17236 [doi]
AB  - Heart failure (HF), continuing to be a notable cause of morbidity and mortality
      worldwide, also is a noteworthy economic burden to the patients. Current medical 
      management of HF has poor efficacy to completely arrest or reverse the
      progression to end-stage disease. As the option of cardiac transplantation
      remains limited to few patients, the stem cell approach continues to be a
      promising one in developing a novel therapy in the treatment of HF. This review
      attempts to discuss and compare the outcomes of numerous clinical trials that
      involved treatment of HF of variable etiologies with stem cells of numerous
      lineages such as bone marrow-derived cells (BMCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs),
      cardiosphere derived progenitor cells (CDCs), etc. We reviewed articles and
      randomized controlled trials (RCT) that used stem cells to treat heart failure.
      The articles and RCT studies were obtained through a search on PubMed and Medline
      databases and performed using regular and medical subject heading (MeSH) keyword 
      search strategy. A total of 17 trial-based studies, along with other articles
      that met the aim of the review, were selected. A discussion of the findings from 
      major clinical trials such as the C-CURE, CHART-1, POSEIDON, POSEIDON-DCM,
      TAC-HFT, and other small scale trials highlights the change in functional and
      mechanical parameters of HF, namely, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF),
      end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), 6-minute walking test
      distance (6MWTD), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels
      and assessment of New York heart association (NYHA) class of heart failure, and
      Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) score to reflect
      improvement in quality of life (QoL) of patients. Out of the studies analyzed,
      the majority reported significant improvements in at least two of the parameters 
      mentioned above. However, more phase three randomized trials are required to
      compare the efficacy of multiple lineages of stem cells, factoring in molecular
      and dosage factors to develop a standardized therapy.

TI  - Automated detection of COVID-19 cough.
PG  - 103175
LID - 10.1016/j.bspc.2021.103175 [doi]
AB  - Easy detection of COVID-19 is a challenge. Quick biological tests do not give
      enough accuracy. Success in the fight against new outbreaks depends not only on
      the efficiency of the tests used, but also on the cost, time elapsed and the
      number of tests that can be done massively. Our proposal provides a solution to
      this challenge. The main objective is to design a freely available, quick and
      efficient methodology for the automatic detection of COVID-19 in raw audio files.
      Our proposal is based on automated extraction of time-frequency cough features
      and selection of the more significant ones to be used to diagnose COVID-19 using 
      a supervised machine-learning algorithm. Random Forest has performed better than 
      the other models analysed in this study. An accuracy close to 90% was obtained.
      This study demonstrates the feasibility of the automatic diagnose of COVID-19
      from coughs, and its applicability to detecting new outbreaks.

TI  - Characteristics and Research Waste Among Randomized Clinical Trials in Gastric
      Cancer.
PG  - e2124760
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.24760 [doi]
AB  - Importance: The results of numerous large randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have 
      changed clinical practice in gastric cancer (GC). However, research waste (ie,
      unpublished data, inadequate reporting, or avoidable design limitations) is still
      a major challenge for evidence-based medicine. Objectives: To determine the
      characteristics of GC RCTs in the past 20 years and the presence of research
      waste and to explore potential targets for improvement. Design, Setting, and
      Participants: In this cross-sectional study of GC RCTs, ClinicalTrials.gov was
      searched for phase 3 or 4 RCTs registered from January 2000 to December 2019
      using the keyword gastric cancer. Independent investigators undertook assessments
      and resolved discrepancies via consensus. Data were analyzed from August through 
      December 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were descriptions
      of the characteristics of GC RCTs and the proportion of studies with signs of
      research waste. Research waste was defined as unpublished data, inadequate
      reporting, or avoidable design limitations. Publication status was determined by 
      searching PubMed and Scopus databases. The adequacy of reporting was evaluated
      using the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) reporting
      guideline checklist. Avoidable design limitations were determined based on
      existing bias or lack of cited systematic literature reviews. In the analyses of 
      research waste, 125 RCTs that ended after June 2016 without publication were
      excluded. Results: A total of 262 GC RCTs were included. The number of RCTs
      increased from 25 trials in 2000 to 2004 to 97 trials in 2015 to 2019, with a
      greater increase among RCTs of targeted therapy or immunotherapy, which increased
      from 0 trials in 2000 to 2004 to 36 trials in 2015 to 2019. The proportion of
      RCTs that were multicenter was higher in non-Asian regions than in Asian regions 
      (50 of 71 RCTs [70.4%] vs 96 of 191 RCTs [50.3%]; P = .004). The analysis of
      research waste included 137 RCTs, of which 81 (59.1%) were published. Among
      published RCTs, 65 (80.2%) were judged to be adequately reported and 63 (77.8%)
      had avoidable design defects. Additionally, 119 RCTs (86.9%) had 1 or more
      features of research waste. Study settings that included blinding (odds ratio
      [OR], 0.56; 95% CI, 0.33-0.93; P = .03), a greater number of participants (ie,
      >/=200 participants; OR, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.01-0.51; P = .01), and external funding 
      support (OR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.08-0.60; P = .004) were associated with lower odds
      of research waste. Additionally, 35 RCTs (49.3%) were referenced in guidelines,
      and 18 RCTs (22.2%) had their prospective data reused. Conclusions and Relevance:
      To our knowledge, this study is the first to describe the characteristics of GC
      RCTs in the past 20 years, and it found a research waste burden, which may
      provide evidence for the development of rational RCTs and reduction of waste in
      the future.

TI  - A bibliometric analysis of the research on hematological tumor microenvironment.
PG  - 1337
LID - 10.21037/atm-21-3924 [doi]
AB  - Background: In recent years, the incidence of hematological tumors has increased.
      The tumor microenvironment (TME) is the local biological environment in the
      process of tumor occurrence and development and is closely related to
      hematological malignancies, including lymphoma and leukemia. This study aims to
      conduct a bibliometric analysis of the research on the hematological TME, reflect
      the general situation of the research in this field, and remind the focus of
      future research. Methods: Search the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-E)
      database on the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC). Use subject terms to
      search tumor microenvironment; the limited search subject is Hematology, and the 
      time range is from 1990 to July 18, 2021. Use CiteSpace software to analyze the
      number of annual papers published, the number of citations, the distribution of
      disciplines, the distribution of countries/institutions, the distribution of
      authors, the distribution of journals, and the frequency of use of keywords and
      its trend of change. Results: There were 1,992 related research articles cited
      77,213 times. The top 5 countries with the number of published papers in this
      field are: the United States, Italy, China, Germany, and the United Kingdom; the 
      top 5 centrally ranked countries are the United States, Italy, Spain, France, and
      Japan. Literature and cooperation are mainly from the United States. The top
      three researchers with several published papers are Anderson KC, Ansell SM, and
      Gascoyne RD. Their centrality scores are all low, with only 5 researchers
      reaching above 0.01, and there is less collaboration between the authors.
      High-quality papers are from Blood, Cancer Res, P Natl Acad Sci USA, and Nature. 
      Keyword analysis shows that immunotherapy is the current focus of research in
      this field. Conclusions: The research on the microenvironment of hematological
      malignancies is rapidly developing. At present, the main research focus is on
      targeted immunotherapy.

      A Bibliometric Analysis.
PG  - 720787
LID - 10.3389/fpubh.2021.720787 [doi]
AB  - Background: Disaster epidemiology has not attracted enough attention in the past 
      few decades and still faces significant challenges. This study aimed to
      systematically analyze the evolving trends and research hotspots in disaster
      epidemiology and provide insights into disaster epidemiology. Methods: We
      searched the Scopus and Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) databases between 
      1985 and 2020 to identify relevant literature on disaster epidemiology. The
      retrieval strategies were TITLE-ABS-KEY (disaster epidemiology) and TS =
      (disaster AND epidemiology). Bibliometrix, VOSviewer 1.6.6 and SigmaPlot 12.5
      were used to analyze the key bibliometric indicators, including trends and annual
      publications, the contributions of countries, institutions, journals and authors,
      and research hotspots. Results: A total of 1,975 publications were included.
      There was an increasing trend in publications over the past 35 years. The USA was
      the most productive country. The most frequent institutions and journals were
      Fukushima Medical University and Prehospital and Disaster Medicine. Galea S made 
      significant contributions to this field. "Epidemiology" was the highest-frequency
      keyword. COVID-19 was highly cited after 2019. Three research hotspots were
      identified: (i) the short- and long-term adverse health effects of disasters on
      the population; (ii) COVID-19 pandemic and emergency preparedness; and (iii)
      disaster management. Conclusions: In recent decades, the USA was a global leader 
      in disaster epidemiology. Disaster management, the short- and long-term health
      effects of disasters, and the COVID-19 pandemic reflected the research focuses.
      Our results suggest that these directions will remain research hotspots in the
      future. International collaboration is also expected to widen and deepen in the
      field of disaster epidemiology.

TI  - Breast Cancer in the Caribbean.
PG  - e17042
LID - 10.7759/cureus.17042 [doi]
AB  - Breast cancer (BC) is one of the leading causes of death among women globally. In
      the Caribbean, there is a higher mortality rate compared with North American and 
      European countries which have higher incidence rates. We conducted a literature
      review to examine the BC dynamic in the Caribbean and determine the areas where
      further investigations are needed. The PubMed database was used for identifying
      relevant studies using a combination of specific keyword searches. All studies
      focusing on BC within the defined Caribbean population were selected for this
      review. A total of 117 papers were included. The data were organized and
      presented under the following headings and reported according to the country
      where available: BC incidence and mortality, patient demographics,
      clinicopathology, genetics, behavioral risks, diagnosis and treatment, and BC
      control. Our review uncovered major variability in the incidence, management,
      etiology, and mortality of BC among Caribbean countries. Low-resource countries
      are burdened by more advanced disease with expected poorer BC outcomes (i.e.,
      shorter periods of disease-free survival). Countries with established national
      cancer registries seem to have a better approach to the management of BC. The
      introduction of cancer treatment programs in association with international
      nonprofit groups has shown tremendous improvement in quality, accessible cancer
      care for patients, particularly in low- and middle-income settings. BC research
      is relatively limited in the Caribbean, lacking in both scope and consistency.
      The unique Caribbean BC population of diverse ethnicities, environmental
      influence, immigrants, socioeconomic status, and sociocultural practices allows
      an optimal opportunity for epidemiological investigations that can provide deeper
      insights into the status of BC.

AB  - Seizure clusters (SCs) are episodes of consecutive seizures that occur within a
      short period. The treatment patterns of rescue medications (RMs), as well as the 
      burden of SCs, have not been assessed. A systematic literature search on
      Embase.com (in PubMed and Embase), supplemented with keyword-based and
      bibliographic searches, identified 44 articles for disease burden, three
      treatment guidelines, and three articles for treatment patterns. Common SC
      definitions were >/=3 seizures/24 h, >/=2/24 h and >/=2/6 h. The rate of SCs in
      prospective studies ranged from 21.7 %-42.5 %. The frequency of status
      epilepticus (SE) was higher in SC patients. SCs were associated with higher
      seizure frequency, higher risk of treatment resistance, and lower likelihood of
      seizure remission. Quality of life (QoL) was lower in children with SCs than in
      those with isolated seizures. Seizure-related hospitalization was more common in 
      SC than non-SC patients. SCs adversely affected the productivity of patients and 
      their caregivers. In outpatients with SCs, RMs were prescribed to 24.6 %-89.6 %
      and utilized by 15.6 %-44.5 %, with rates being higher in children. Key reasons
      for RM under-utilization were lack of seizure action plans, poor
      physician-patient communication, and concerns with administration route. In
      conclusion, SCs are associated with a higher risk of SE, treatment resistance,
      and low rate of seizure remission. They adversely affect patient and caregiver
      QoL and work productivity. However, RMs are under-prescribed, and there is an
      urgent need to improve recognition of SCs, improve use of seizure action plans,
      and remove barriers to RM use.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Measuring public response during COVID-19 is an important way of
      ensuring the suitability and effectiveness of epidemic response efforts. An
      analysis of social media provides an approximation of public sentiment during an 
      emergency like the current pandemic. The measures introduced across the globe to 
      help curtail the spread of the coronavirus have led to the development of a
      situation labeled as a "perfect storm," triggering a wave of domestic violence.
      As people use social media to communicate their experiences, analyzing public
      discourse and sentiment on social platforms offers a way to understand concerns
      and issues related to domestic violence during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: 
      This study was based on an analysis of public discourse and sentiment related to 
      domestic violence during the stay-at-home periods of the COVID-19 pandemic in
      Australia in 2020. It aimed to understand the more personal self-reported
      experiences, emotions, and reactions toward domestic violence that were not
      always classified or collected by official public bodies during the pandemic.
      METHODS: We searched social media and news posts in Australia using key terms
      related to domestic violence and COVID-19 during 2020 via digital analytics tools
      to determine sentiments related to domestic violence during this period. RESULTS:
      The study showed that the use of sentiment and discourse analysis to assess
      social media data is useful in measuring the public expression of feelings and
      sharing of resources in relation to the otherwise personal experience of domestic
      violence. There were a total of 63,800 posts across social media and news media. 
      Within these posts, our analysis found that domestic violence was mentioned an
      average of 179 times a day. There were 30,100 tweets, 31,700 news reports, 1500
      blog posts, 548 forum posts, and 7 comments (posted on news and blog websites).
      Negative or neutral sentiment centered on the sharp rise in domestic violence
      during different lockdown periods of the 2020 pandemic, and neutral and positive 
      sentiments centered on praise for efforts that raised awareness of domestic
      violence as well as the positive actions of domestic violence charities and
      support groups in their campaigns. There were calls for a positive and proactive 
      handling (rather than a mishandling) of the pandemic, and results indicated a
      high level of public discontent related to the rising rates of domestic violence 
      and the lack of services during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: This study provided a 
      timely understanding of public sentiment related to domestic violence during the 
      COVID-19 lockdown periods in Australia using social media analysis. Social media 
      represents an important avenue for the dissemination of information; posts can be
      widely dispersed and easily accessed by a range of different communities who are 
      often difficult to reach. An improved understanding of these issues is important 
      for future policy direction. Heightened awareness of this could help agencies
      tailor and target messaging to maximize impact.

LID - 10.1007/s42690-021-00616-2 [doi]
AB  - The International Journal of Tropical Insect Science (Int J Trop Insect Sci) is a
      peer-reviewed journal established in 1980 to promote insect science mainly in the
      tropics. This study aimed to provide a Bibliometric overview of Int J Trop Insect
      Sci publications and citations between 2012 and 2020, ending September 2020. A
      sample of 488 documents extracted from the Web of Science (WoS) was analysed
      using widely used bioclimatic indicators. The articles were written by 1726
      authors. During this period, the most productive authors comprised S Roy,
      followed by S Ekesi, S Subramanian and M Tamo. The dominant keyword was
      'resistance', followed by 'Homoptera'. India took a leading position in Single
      Country Publications (SCP) while Kenya took the lead in Multiple Country
      Publications (MCP). Bibliometric analysis reveals vibrant collaboration between
      African and Western countries and active publication of multi-country authored
      articles. We conclude that there is an increasing trend for collaboration among
      different countries on the general topic of insect science. Research in insect
      science has the potential to impact both academic researchers and practitioners
      the knowledge use chain. This study will help researchers, journal editors,
      science policy makers managers, and others working in the biodiversity space and 
      potential research gaps needing for further studies.

TI  - Is YouTube an adequate patient resource about orthodontic retention? A
      cross-sectional analysis of content and quality.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The study aimed to evaluate the content and quality of information 
      offered by YouTube for patients seeking information related to orthodontic
      retainers. METHODS: YouTube was searched using the keyword "orthodontic
      retainers" from Google Trends. From the first 120 results, 97 videos were
      selected to be analyzed. Videos were rated for quality by video information and
      quality index (VIQI) and the global quality scale (GQS). Videos were classified
      as low- and high-content groups using a 10-point score considering several
      retainer-related topics. Mann-Whitney U tests, chi-square tests, and Pearson
      correlation coefficients were used for statistical evaluations. RESULTS: Most
      YouTube videos were uploaded by dentists/specialists (62.9%). We classified 12
      videos as high content and 85 as low content. Instructions on the use of the
      orthodontic retainer was the most commonly covered topic (42.3%), followed by the
      effect on oral hygiene (38.1%), definition (37.1%), procedure of preparing
      orthodontic retainers (33.0%), and procedure of positioning (30.9%). A lower
      percentage of videos (6.2%) mentioned soft tissue irritation. The high-content
      video group had a significantly higher median value of GQS score and VIQI (P
      <0.001). The correlation between GQS and VIQI was strong (r = 0.698; P <0.01).
      CONCLUSIONS: The content of YouTube videos for orthodontic retainers could not be
      considered as an adequate source of information for patients on orthodontic
      retainers. Most videos included instructions on the use of orthodontic retainers,
      but fewer videos mentioned the effect on speech performance and soft tissue
      irritations.

TI  - Enucleation of Biliary Cystadenomas: a Review.
PG  - 2700-2706
LID - 10.1007/s11605-021-05106-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Biliary cystadenomas are very rare benign tumors which can transform 
      into cystadenocarcinomas. The largest case series reported on 221 cases over 30
      years from 10 HPB centers, i.e., about 7 cases per center per decade. The
      recommended treatment is liver resection. Enucleation of biliary cystadenomas has
      been done rarely. The purpose of the study was to determine the outcome of
      enucleation of these cysts, particularly the mortality rate and the recurrence
      rate. METHODS: A keyword search was done using OVID followed by a search of the
      bibliography of papers describing the enucleation of biliary cystadenomas. Of 45 
      articles obtained, 25 were retained. The main reasons for exclusion were
      non-English language and review articles. RESULTS: One hundred three patients in 
      the 25 studies were treated with enucleation. Thirteen studies described prior
      treatments that had failed with resulting recurrence requiring re-treatment. The 
      main indication for enucleation was large central cysts for which liver resection
      would be high risk. There were no postoperative deaths in patients treated by
      enucleation. Thirteen studies provided long-term follow-up in 40 patients, a
      substantial number given the rarity of the tumor. There were no recurrences or
      transformations to malignancy. CONCLUSIONS: Enucleation seems to represent a
      reasonable treatment technique for BCA, especially when a large cystic lesion is 
      located centrally and/or would require a large liver resection with significant
      loss of parenchyma.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We systematically evaluated the global research trends in robotic
      application on the spine through bibliometric analysis and mapping knowledge
      domains. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed of the PubMed and 
      Web of Science, including the Science Citation Index Expanded, databases. The
      number, countries, journals, and authors of the publications, total citations,
      average publication year, and institution sources were analyzed using Microsoft
      Excel, the Online Analysis Platform of Bibliometrics, and VOSviewer. The hotspots
      were analyzed and visualized using VOSviewer. RESULTS: We identified a total of
      2135 publications. The United States ranked first in the number of publications
      (n = 824; 38.63%) and frequency of citations (n = 29,075). Northwestern
      University had the highest number of publications (n = 67) and Harvard University
      the highest number of citations (n = 4198). The Journal of NeuroEngineering and
      Rehabilitation published the largest number of reports (n = 73), and the most
      frequently cited journal was Nature (n = 3844 citations). The research hotspots
      were divided into 3 categories analyzed by VOSviewer: rehabilitation, basic
      science, and surgery. According to the average publication year, the most recent 
      hotspot was radiation exposure, and the earliest hotspot was radiosurgery.
      CONCLUSIONS: The number of studies of robotic application on the spine has
      continued to increase. The United States was the greatest contributor to robotic 
      applications on the spine. Robot-assisted rehabilitation for neurological and
      orthopedic lesions is still a major research hotspot. The range of robotic
      applications on the spine has expanded from assisted rehabilitation to assisted
      rehabilitation and surgery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Typical cloth and medical masks, which are mandatory to wear during
      the COVID 19 pandemic, create visual barrier, obscure linguistic and nonverbal
      communication and interaction. Ski-slope hearing loss patients often don't admit 
      their auditory insufficiency and do not use hearing aids due to acceptable speech
      intelligibility by using visual access to the mouth and other potential facial
      cues. PURPOSE: To assess the impact of universal face medical masks in public
      places on motivation to using hearing aids of patients with ski-slope hearing
      loss. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All the 504 patients (18-65 years old), who applied
      for < hearing care assistance and for the first time bought hearing aid were
      included. 266 patients (group A) applied from June to November 2020, when wearing
      facial masks was mandatory; 238 patients (group B) applied from June to November 
      2019, when wearing facial masks wasn't required. In both groups patients, who
      fulfilled the following criteria, were selected: 1) binaural mild to severe
      sensorineural ski-slope hearing loss lasting more than 3 years; 2) no progression
      of hearing loss within the last 3 years; 3) pure tone audiometry <20 dB HL at
      125-1000 Hz frequencies; 4) hearing care with mono- or binaural hearing aids with
      the receiver-in-the-canal open-type. Questionnaires were administered to eligible
      patients in group A to assess the motivational components of acquiring hearing
      aids. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: In group A, 74 (28%) patients received hearing aids
      according to the inclusion criteria, and in group B, 46 (19%) patients received
      hearing aids (p=0.033). Significant factors determining hearing aid acquisition
      were lack of visual contact when wearing a mask, communication difficulties in
      noisy environments and lack of intelligibility in a concert hall or lecture.
      CONCLUSION: Patients' motivation to hearing care grows in mandatory wearing
      facial masks conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic leading to an increase in
      patients using hearing aids.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study was conducted to assess public awareness and policy
      challenges faced by practicing nurses. METHODS: After collecting nurse-related
      news articles published before and after 'the Thanks to You Challenge' campaign
      (between December 31, 2019, and July 15, 2020), keywords were extracted via
      preprocessing. A three-step method keyword analysis, latent Dirichlet allocation 
      topic modeling, and keyword network analysis was used to examine the text and the
      structure of the selected news articles. RESULTS: Top 30 keywords with similar
      occurrences were collected before and after the campaign. The five dominant
      topics before the campaign were: pandemic, infection of medical staff, local
      transmission, medical resources, and return of overseas Koreans. After the
      campaign, the topics 'infection of medical staff' and 'return of overseas
      Koreans' disappeared, but 'the Thanks to You Challenge' emerged as a dominant
      topic. A keyword network analysis revealed that the word of nurse was linked with
      keywords like thanks and campaign, through the word of sacrifice. These words
      formed interrelated domains of 'the Thanks to You Challenge' topic. CONCLUSION:
      The findings of this study can provide useful information for understanding
      various issues and social perspectives on COVID-19 nursing. The major themes of
      news reports lagged behind the real problems faced by nurses in COVID-19 crisis. 
      While the press tends to focus on heroism and whole society, issues and policies 
      mutually beneficial to public and nursing need to be further explored and
      enhanced by nurses.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Smartphones have become an integral part of our lives with
      unprecedented popularity and a diverse selection of apps. The continuous
      upgrading of information technology has also enabled smartphones to display great
      potential in the field of health care. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the
      future research direction of mobile health (mHealth) by analyzing its research
      trends and latest research hotspots. METHODS: This study collected
      mHealth-related literature published between 2000 and 2020 from the Web of
      Science database. Descriptive statistics of publication trends of mHealth
      research were determined by analyzing the annual number of publications in the
      literature and annual number of publications by country. We constructed
      visualization network maps of country (or regional) collaborations and
      author-provided keyword co-occurrences, as well as overlay visualization maps of 
      the average publication year of author-provided keywords to analyze the hotspots 
      and research trends in mHealth research. RESULTS: In total, 12,593
      mHealth-related research papers published between 2000 and 2020 were found. The
      results showed an exponential growth trend in the number of annual publications
      in mHealth literature. JMIR mHealth and uHealth, the Journal of Medical Internet 
      Research, and JMIR Research Protocols were the 3 top journals with respect to
      number of publications. The United States remained the leading contributor to the
      literature in this area (5294/12,593, 42.0%), well ahead of other countries and
      regions. Other countries and regions also showed a clear trend of annual
      increases in the number of mHealth publications. The 4 countries with the largest
      number of publications-the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and
      Australia-were found to cooperate more closely. The rest of the countries and
      regions showed a clear geographic pattern of cooperation. The keyword
      co-occurrence analysis of the top 100 authors demonstrated 5 clusters, namely,
      development of mHealth medical technology and its application to various
      diseases, use of mHealth technology to improve basic public health and health
      policy, mHealth self-health testing and management in daily life, adolescent use 
      of mHealth, and mHealth in mental health. The research trends revealed a gradual 
      shift in mHealth research from health policy and improving public health care to 
      the development and social application of mHealth technologies. CONCLUSIONS: To
      the best of our knowledge, the most current bibliometric analysis dates back to
      2016. However, the number of mHealth research published between 2017 and 2020
      exceeds the previous total. The results of this study shed light on the latest
      hotspots and trends in mHealth research. These findings provide a useful overview
      of the development of the field; they may also serve as a valuable reference and 
      provide guidance for researchers in the digital health field.

AB  - The aim of the study was to provide practical advice to restaurant managers for
      improving star ratings as well as information for researchers on how the pandemic
      has impacted established determinants of satisfaction. The study examined
      criteria used by restaurant customers in assigning star-ratings on Yelp during
      the COVID-19 pandemic using keyword analysis and Multiple Correspondence
      Analysis. In evaluating restaurants, the reviewers focused on service, overall
      experience, and food quality. Service was discussed in relation to the pandemic
      and included safety of the dine-in experience, contrasted with take-out options
      and compliance with COVID-19 guidelines. These criteria applied differently with 
      lower-star reviews focusing on safety, social distancing, and mask policies.
      Higher-star reviews focused on take-out/delivery services, high-quality food, and
      an overall positive experience. The study provides valuable contributions to our 
      understanding of how the COVID-19 pandemic will impact the restaurant sector in a
      post-pandemic world.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the literature knowledge structure and acupoint matching
      rules of acupuncture for depression. METHODS: The articles regarding acupuncture 
      for depression published from January 1 of 1984 to October 19 of 2020 were
      searched in CNKI database. CiteSpace5.7.R2 software was used to import the
      literature data, and the keyword cluster analysis, emergence analysis and
      time-zone analysis of articles and acupoints were conducted, and the map of
      scientific knowledge was draw. RESULTS: A total of 3524 articles were included to
      the knowledge structure analysis, while 601 articles into the acupoint matching
      rules analysis. There were 13 keyword clusters of acupuncture for depression,
      with "post-stroke depression" and "electroacupuncture treatment" as
      high-frequency keywords, and "electroacupuncture treatment" and "Hamilton
      depression scale" had high centrality, and "electroacupuncture treatment" had the
      highest emergence intensity. The keywords such as "electroacupuncture treatment" 
      and "Hamilton depression scale", etc. appeared the earliest, followed by
      "post-stroke depression", "fluoxetine" and "auricular point therapy", etc.
      According to traditional Chinese medicine theory, acupoint keywords were divided 
      into four clusters: 1 in circlecore acupoint, 2 in circlereplenishing-spleen and 
      dispelling phlegm, dispersing-liver and relieving depression, reinforcing qi and 
      nourishing blood, 3 in circleback-shu points, five-zhi points, 4 in
      circleinducing-resuscitation and opening-closes. CONCLUSION: The main knowledge
      structure of acupuncture for depression includes five parts: treatment method,
      depression type, TCM-related diseases, literature type and curative effect index.
      Clinical acupoint matching should adhere to the principle of "focusing the
      disease before syndrome" and "combination of disease and syndrome", and treatment
      should be modified for the syndromes of phlegm stagnation blocking,
      liver-stagnation and qi-stagnation, and deficiency of both qi and blood.

AB  - Objectives: To review the literature related to bronchopulmonary dysplasia in
      extremely pre-mature infants, summarize research direction, and report trends.
      Methods: CiteSpace is a Java application which supports visual exploration with
      knowledge discovery in bibliographic databases. Relevant articles from 2008 to
      2020 were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection database, and we
      extracted the following data: title, abstract, year, keywords, author,
      organization, journal and cited literature. We downloaded the data into CiteSpace
      (version 5.7.R3) to summarize countries, institutions, journals, and authors. We 
      visualized the data with a knowledge map, collaborative network analysis, cluster
      analysis, and burst keyword analysis. Results: We identified 610 articles on
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia in extremely pre-mature infants. The United States had
      the most articles on this topic (302 articles), followed by Canada (49 articles) 
      and Germany (44 articles). The top three institutions, high-yield journals, and
      authors were all from the United States. The most common keywords were
      neurodevelopmental disorders, active perinatal care, mechanical ventilation,
      inflammation, pulmonary hypertension, low-dose hydrocortisone, development, and
      patent ductus arteriosus. Conclusions: This study illustrates the trends and
      frontiers in the study of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in extremely pre-mature
      infants. The current research direction is to identify the risk factors in
      developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia in extremely pre-mature infants.

TI  - Evaluation of the golden proportion in the natural dentition: A systematic review
      and meta-analysis.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Different proportions of tooth width ratios have been
      evaluated, and the golden proportion is the best known. Although the prevalence
      of the golden proportion has been evaluated in different ethnic groups and
      populations, a meta-analysis of these studies is lacking. PURPOSE: The purpose of
      this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the existence and
      suitability of the golden proportion for tooth width ratios and to assess the
      prevalence of the golden proportion among populations. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A
      systematic search based on the Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO) 
      and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
      guidelines was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase 
      in January 2021 without any time limitations and included English and
      non-English-language articles. Additional studies were identified by searching
      the reference lists of the retrieved articles. Two reviewers independently
      performed the literature search and data extraction, selecting articles based on 
      the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eligible studies were selected based on the
      inclusion criteria, and quality assessments were conducted. Descriptive
      statistics were applied for a number of outcome measures. Using a meta-analysis
      software program, data extracted from each selected study were statistically
      combined by using weighted mean differences and 95% confidence intervals, and
      heterogeneity was calculated for each measurement. RESULTS: A total of 566
      articles were retrieved based on the keyword search. After the articles were
      assessed based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, only 6 articles were
      included in the meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes of the review and
      analyses demonstrate that evidence supporting the existence of the golden
      proportion in natural smiles is lacking and that the existence of the golden
      proportion in dentistry is a myth and not a fact. However, the golden percentage 
      theory can be applied with modified percentages that consider critical aspects of
      esthetic dentistry.

      Review.
PG  - 698111
LID - 10.3389/fpubh.2021.698111 [doi]
AB  - COVID-19 vaccine is regarded as the most promising means of limiting the spread
      of or eliminating the pandemic. The success of this strategy will rely on the
      rate of vaccine acceptance globally. The study aims to examine the factors that
      influence COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, intention, and hesitancy. PubMed was
      searched comprehensively for articles using the keyword "COVID-19 vaccine
      surveys." Of the 192 records, 22 studies were eligible for the review. Eighty-two
      percent of these studies were conducted among the general population. Gender,
      age, education, and occupation were some of the socio-demographic variables
      associated with vaccine acceptance. Variables such as trust in authorities, risk 
      perception of COVID-19 infection, vaccine efficacy, current or previous influenza
      vaccination, and vaccine safety affected vaccine acceptance. Globally, in March
      2020, the average vaccine acceptance observed was 86% which dropped to 54% in
      July 2020 which later increased to 72% in September 2020. Globally, the average
      rate of vaccine hesitancy in April 2020 was 21%, which increased to 36% in July
      2020 and later declined to 16% in October 2020. Large variability in vaccine
      acceptance and high vaccine hesitancy can influence the efforts to eliminate the 
      COVID-19. Addressing the barriers and facilitators of vaccines will be crucial in
      implementing effective and tailored interventions to attain maximum vaccine
      coverage.

TI  - The Effectiveness of Reminiscence Therapy on Alleviating Depressive Symptoms in
      Older Adults: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 709853
LID - 10.3389/fpsyg.2021.709853 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Depression is one of the most common problems faced by older adults.
      Reminiscence therapy, defined as using the recall of past events, feelings, and
      thoughts facilitating pleasure, is one type of psychotherapy that could alleviate
      depressive feelings among older adults, improve their quality of life, and help
      them live independently. Reminiscence therapy originated from geriatric
      psychiatry, and is an effective non-pharmacological intervention that could be
      structured or unstructured and be conducted individually or in a group. The
      current systematic review was designed to summarize and review existing evidence 
      on the effect of reminiscence therapy on depression in older adults. Methods: We 
      conducted a systematic review from January 2000 to Mar 2021 using 10 electronic
      databases in English and Chinese languages, including Medline, Embase, Cinahl,
      PsychInfo, Cochrane, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Science Direct, CNKI, and
      WANFANG. We excluded studies that didn't use randomized controlled trials (RCT)
      from the meta-analysis. The selected studies were scored using the Cochrane Risk 
      of Bias tool. The RevMan 5.0 was used in subgroup analysis depending on how the
      interventions were classified. Results: We extracted 527 studies based on keyword
      searches, of which 10 RCTs met inclusion criteria were included in the
      meta-analysis. The meta-analysis yielded high heterogeneity, and the analyses of 
      significant subgroups showed that reminiscence therapy has a significant effect
      on relieving depressive symptoms in older adults. Reminiscence therapy benefits
      older adults with chronic illness and those on antidepressants as well. The
      effect and cost-effectiveness of group reminiscence therapy were higher than
      individual reminiscence therapy. And some specific types of group reminiscence
      therapy have a significant effect on improving depression and secondary outcomes,
      including life satisfaction. Although the effectiveness of structured and
      unstructured group reminiscence on depression has no significant differences
      according to current evidence, the structured therapy is more replicable,
      generalizable, and user-friendly due to its detailed protocol for new therapists.
      Furthermore, reminiscence therapy is more effective for older women and older
      adults with more severe depressive symptoms. Conclusion: Reminiscence therapy
      significantly increased older adults' remission from depression and quality of
      life immediately after the intervention. However, the evidence-based protocol and
      implementation of reminiscence interventions need to be further developed and
      standardized to facilitate global use. Moreover, it remains unclear on the
      long-term effect of reminiscence therapy. Based on the limitations of the current
      study, more rigorous evidence is needed from studies with large sample sizes, RCT
      design, and longer follow-up periods. Future studies could also explore the
      effect of different types of reminiscence therapy. Furthermore, qualitative data 
      should be included to better understand older adults' narrative and experiences
      with reminiscence therapy. Future studies could also investigate the impact of
      reminiscence therapy on older relatives as a part of outcome measure to explore
      the efficacious mechanism of reminiscence therapy in alleviating older adults'
      depressive symptoms.

TI  - Effects of Different Glucose-Lowering Measures on Maternal and Infant Outcomes in
      Pregnant Women with Gestational Diabetes: A Network Meta-analysis.
PG  - 2715-2753
LID - 10.1007/s13300-021-01142-7 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: A network meta-analysis was conducted to compare and rank the
      effects of different glucose-lowering measures on maternal and infant outcomes in
      pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). METHODS: We searched the
      PubMed, CNKI, Embase, Cochrane Library, Wanfang, and Weipu databases for relevant
      studies published between database establishment and June 2021. Study retrieval
      involved subject-heading and keyword searches. Randomized controlled trials
      (RCTs) with different glucose-lowering treatments for GDM patients were included.
      The Cochrane tool was used to assess bias risk. Pairwise and network
      meta-analyses were used to compare and rank the effects of different hypoglycemic
      measures on maternal and infant outcomes in pregnant women with GDM. RESULTS: We 
      included 41 RCTs involving 6245 pregnant women with GDM. Patients treated with
      insulin had a higher incidence of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) occupancy
      (1.3, 95% CI 1.0-1.7) than those treated with metformin. The insulin (1.5, 95% CI
      1.1-2.1 and 1.8, 95% CI 1.0-3.3) and glyburide (2.0, 95% CI 1.2-3.2 and 2.5, 95% 
      CI 1.1-8.4) groups exhibited higher incidences of neonatal hypoglycemia and large
      for gestational age (LGA) newborns than the metformin group. The glyburide group 
      exhibited a lower probability of cesarean section than the metformin (0.76, 95%
      CI 0.55-1.0) and insulin (0.71, 95% CI 0.52-0.96) groups. Preeclampsia incidence 
      in the diet and exercise groups was significantly lower than in the metformin
      (0.19, 95% CI 0.043-0.72) and insulin (0.15, 95% CI 0.032-0.52) groups. No
      intervention significantly reduced the incidences of macrosomia, preterm birth,
      gestational hypertension, or respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). The ranking
      results showed that the metformin group had the lowest rates of neonatal
      hypoglycemia, macrosomia, LGA, and NICU occupancy. The glyburide group had the
      lowest NICU occupancy and cesarean section rates and the highest neonatal
      hypoglycemia, LGA, preeclampsia, and gestational hypertension rates. The diet and
      exercise group had the lowest preterm delivery and preeclampsia rates and the
      highest NICU occupancy rate. CONCLUSION: Metformin is a potentially superior
      choice for GDM treatment because it is associated with minimal incidences of
      multiple adverse pregnancy outcome indicators and does not lead to high values of
      certain adverse outcome indices. Other hypoglycemic agent or diet groups exhibit 
      high incidences of certain adverse outcomes. Therefore, when selecting a GDM
      treatment strategy, the efficacies and risks of different treatment programs
      should be evaluated according to the scenario in hand.

AB  - Despite the increasing use of chemical additives in construction and their
      potential threat to the environment and human health, many C&DW studies lack a
      comprehensive view of chemicals of concern (COC) in C&DW. This study
      systematically reviewed published studies from 2010 to August 2021 using a
      keyword search methodology to explore COC in C&DW fine residues based on 73
      articles identified from 5 prominent databases. Results show that trace/heavy
      metals (As, Cr, Cu, Cd, and Pb) as well as high concentrations of toxic gasses
      (methane, hydrogen sulphide and mercury vapour) have been reported in landfills. 
      Besides, organic chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,
      polychlorinated biphenyls, and brominated flame retardants have been found in
      landfill leachates in the Netherlands and widely detected in landfill leachates
      in Sweden, Japan, and Canada. The potential of these contaminants to cause health
      complications has also been reported. Carcinogenicity, liver and kidney damage,
      cumulative damage, neurological disorders and foetal damage were reported as
      associated health implications of exposure to COC from C&DW. A waste disposal
      lens was used to explore the factors that influence the environment and human
      health impacts (pH, gypsum and organic content, size fraction, atmospheric
      exposure and liquid infiltration rate). Despite environmental and health issues
      relating to C&DW fine residues, the ultimate destination for C&DW fine residues
      remains in general landfills. Although significant efforts in managing C&DW have 
      been implemented at various levels, those specifically targeting C&DW fine
      residues remain sparse.

TI  - Person-environment fit of environmental support provided during medical
      consultations with older patients.
LID - 10.1007/s00391-021-01961-0 [doi]
AB  - As some cognitive functions decline in old age, the ability to decide about
      important life events such as medical treatment is endangered. Environmental
      support to improve the comprehension of health-related information is therefore
      necessary. With a small-scale explorative approach, the present survey study
      aimed at investigating person-environment fit (PE-fit) of support provided during
      medical consultations. This fit was calculated by assessing the match between
      aids provided by five medical practitioners during medical consultations and aids
      most appreciated by the geriatric patients (N= 88). The results showed that the
      largest discrepancies of used and appreciated aids could be found concerning the 
      opportunity to discuss decisions with relatives, the possibility to take notes,
      the use of objects, pictures and a keyword list. Female patients indicated a
      lower PE-fit. These findings highlight discrepancies between the use of specific 
      aids and the wishes of patients and call for thoughtful use of aids during
      consultations with geriatric patients.

TI  - Quality of healthcare information on YouTube: psoriatic arthritis.
LID - 10.1007/s00393-021-01069-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: YouTube is an increasingly used platform for medical information.
      However, the validity of health-related information on psoriatic arthritis (PsA) 
      on YouTube has not been determined. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to
      evaluate the accuracy and quality of YouTube videos concerning PsA. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: A YouTube search was performed on April 18, 2021, using the keyword
      "psoriatic arthritis." Two independent raters accessed the content, source, and
      detailed characteristics of the included videos. The reliability and quality of
      the videos were analyzed using the modified DISCERN score, Journal of the
      American Medical Association benchmark criteria score, and global quality scale
      score. RESULTS: Of the 200 videos screened, 155 were included in the study after 
      applying the exclusion criteria. A total of 132 (85.2%) videos revealed useful
      information about PsA, whereas the remaining 23 (14.8%) were misleading. Video
      interaction parameters including the median number of views, views per day,
      likes, dislikes, and comments demonstrated no significant difference between the 
      two groups. The videos posted by universities and professional organizations
      displayed the highest reliability and quality scores. CONCLUSION: The majority of
      YouTube videos on PsA contained useful information. However, physicians should
      alert patients to the possibility of misinformation and non-validated sources.
      Professional organizations in the field of rheumatology, such as the American
      College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism, should consider
      collaborating with YouTube to deliver high-quality content.

TI  - Research trends and frontiers on source appointment of soil heavy metal: a
      scientometric review (2000-2020).
PG  - 52764-52779
LID - 10.1007/s11356-021-16151-z [doi]
AB  - In recent years, source appointment of soil heavy metal has attracted growing
      attention. However, few studies have attempted to make a comprehensive and
      systematical review on this topic. For this reason, a total of 1051 publications 
      were retrieved from the Web of Science (WOS) database between 2000 and 2020. A
      scientometric analysis was carried out to reveal the characteristics of
      publications, research power, and research hotspots. CiteSpace was used to
      visualize and summarize the information about the development in this field. The 
      results showed that (1) the number of publications in source appointment of soil 
      heavy metal had increased rapidly; Environmental science and ecology and
      environmental sciences were top 2 most popular subject categories; (2) Research
      power was mainly distributed in Asia, Europe, and North America. China and
      Chinese Academy of Sciences were the most productive country and institution in
      terms of publications in this field. Biao Huang (China) was the most productive
      author. However, Hakanson L (Sweden) was the most influential author in terms of 
      citation frequency; (3) Heavy metal, source identification, and contamination
      were the most frequent keywords. Keyword clustering analysis showed that the
      research hotspots mainly concentrated on air pollution, bioremediation, spatial
      distribution, soil, PCA, and so on; (4) Keyword bursts analysis showed that the
      research frontiers mainly focused on spatial analysis of soil heavy metal and
      exposure risk to human health.

AB  - Safe nursing staffing and patient safety are closely related. A systematic review
      of the literature was carried out, comparing the number of falls in elderly
      inpatients in medical-surgical wards with these staffing levels. A review of
      scientific articles, selected through a keyword search of several electronic

      improved nurse staffing and a decrease in the number of falls in elderly
      inpatients.

TI  - A Model for Evaluating the Performance of a Multiple Keywords Spotting System for
      the Transcription of Historical Handwritten Documents.
LID - 117 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jimaging6110117 [doi]
AB  - This paper proposes a performance model for estimating the user time needed to
      transcribe small collections of handwritten documents using a keyword spotting
      system (KWS) that provides a number of possible transcriptions for each word
      image. The model assumes that only information obtained from a small training set
      is available, and establishes the constraints on the performance measures to
      achieve a reduction of the time for transcribing the content with respect to the 
      time required by human experts. The model is complemented with a procedure for
      computing the parameters of the model and eventually estimating the improvement
      of the time to achieve a complete and error-free transcription of the documents.

TI  - One Step Is Not Enough: A Multi-Step Procedure for Building the Training Set of a
      Query by String Keyword Spotting System to Assist the Transcription of Historical
      Document.
LID - 109 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jimaging6100109 [doi]
AB  - Digital libraries offer access to a large number of handwritten historical
      documents. These documents are available as raw images and therefore their
      content is not searchable. A fully manual transcription is time-consuming and
      expensive while a fully automatic transcription is cheaper but not comparable in 
      terms of accuracy. The performance of automatic transcription systems is strictly
      related to the composition of the training set. We propose a multi-step procedure
      that exploits a Keyword Spotting system and human validation for building up a
      training set in a time shorter than the one required by a fully manual procedure.
      The multi-step procedure was tested on a data set made up of 50 pages extracted
      from the Bentham collection. The palaeographer that transcribed the data set with
      the multi-step procedure instead of the fully manual procedure had a time gain of
      52.54%. Moreover, a small size training set that allowed the keyword spotting
      system to show a precision value greater than the recall value was built with the
      multi-step procedure in a time equal to 35.25% of the time required for
      annotating the whole data set.

      systems.

AB  - This dataset accompanies the meta-analysis entitled "Intercropping increases soil
      extracellular enzyme activity: A meta-analysis" Curtright and Tiemann (2021).
      Sustainable agriculture practices often aim to increase plant diversity. One
      means of doing this is through intercropping, where two or more plants are grown 
      in the same field at the same time. Aboveground plant diversity may result in
      changes to the functioning of belowground microbial communities. Soil enzyme
      activities are frequently used as indicators of soil health and descriptors of
      soil nutrient cycling. While some studies have described the effect of
      intercropping on soil enzyme activities, results vary widely. To assess the
      overall effect that intercropping has on soil enzyme activities and describe the 
      largest sources of variation, we performed a global meta-analysis of all studies 
      found in the literature reporting enzyme activities in an intercropping system.
      Data were collected using exhaustive keyword searches on studies published
      through January 2021. We provide here a dataset of 969 observations across 100
      studies. In addition to average enzyme activities in intercropping, metadata on
      environmental, edaphic, and agronomic properties were also collected.

TI  - A 20-Year Research Trend Analysis of the Influence of Anesthesia on Tumor
      Prognosis Using Bibliometric Methods.
PG  - 683232
LID - 10.3389/fonc.2021.683232 [doi]
AB  - Background: Bibliometric analysis is used to gain a systematic understanding of
      developments in the field of the influence of anesthesia on tumor prognosis and
      changes in research hot spots over the past 20 years. Methods: Relevant
      publications from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) were downloaded on
      May 5, 2021. Acquired data were then analyzed using the Online Analysis Platform 
      of Literature Metrology (http://biblimetric.com) and the CiteSpace software was
      used to analyze and predict trends and hot spots in this field. Results: 1,521
      publications on the influence of anesthesia on tumor prognosis were identified
      and 1494 qualifying records were included in the final analysis. The leading
      country in this field was the United States of America (USA). The University of
      Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX, USA) and Pennsylvania State
      University (State College, PA, USA) featured the highest number of publications
      among all institutions. Co-citation cluster labels revealed characteristics of
      ten main clusters: total intravenous anesthesia, opioid growth factor receptor,
      gastric cancer cell, opioid receptor, murine model, natural killer cell activity,
      health-related quality, glioma cell, opioid switching and mu-type opioid
      receptor. Keyword burst detection indicated that randomized controlled trials
      (RCTs), volatile anesthetics, and ropivacaine were the newly emerging research
      hot spots. Conclusions: This study compiled 1494 publications covering anesthesia
      and tumor prognosis research and showed that the direction of these studies is
      likely in transition from opioids and their receptors to other anesthetics, and
      from retrospective studies to prospective randomized controlled trials. It
      provides guidance for further research and clinical applications on choosing
      anesthetic methods and drugs.

TI  - Scientometric Analysis of Medicinal and Edible Plant Coptis.
PG  - 725162
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2021.725162 [doi]
AB  - Objective: A scientometric analysis to obtain knowledge mapping of Coptis
      revealed the current research situation, knowledge base and research hotspots in 
      Coptis research. Methods: Coptis-related documents published from 1987 to 2020
      were selected through the Web of Science Core Collection. CiteSpace, VOSviewer
      and Microsoft Excel were used to construct knowledge maps of the Coptis research 
      field. Results: A total of 367 documents and their references were analyzed.
      These papers were primarily published in mainland China (214), followed by Japan 
      (57) and South Korea (52), and they each formed respective cooperation networks. 
      The document co-citation analysis suggested that the identification of Coptis
      Salisb. species, the production of alkaloids, and the mechanisms of action of
      these alkaloids formed the knowledge bases in this field. A keyword analysis
      further revealed that the research hotspots were primarily concentrated in three 
      fields of research involving berberine, Coptis chinensis Franch, and Coptis
      japonica (Thunb) Makino. Oxidative stress, rat plasma (for the determination of
      plasma alkaloid contents), and Alzheimer's disease are recent research hotspots
      associated with Coptis. Conclusion: Coptis research was mainly distributed in
      three countries: China, Japan, and South Korea. Researchers were concerned with
      the identification of Coptis species, the production of Coptis alkaloids, and the
      efficacy and pharmacological mechanism of the constituent alkaloids. In addition,
      the anti-oxidative stress, pharmacokinetics, and Alzheimer's disease treatment of
      Coptis are new hotspots in this field. This study provides a reference for Coptis
      researchers.

TI  - The Protective Agents Used against Acrylamide Toxicity: An In Vitro Cell Culture 
      Study-Based Review.
PG  - 367-381
LID - 10.22074/cellj.2021.7286 [doi]
AB  - Acrylamide is a dangerous electrophile with the potency to react with many
      biological moieties including proteins, and nucleic acids as well as other
      macromolecules. Acrylamide was first only known a chemical exposed in working
      areas as a neurotoxicant, it was later discovered that beyond just being a
      neurotoxicant exposed in industrial areas, acrylamide is exposed via daily foods 
      as well. As such, several strategies have been sought to be developed to relieve 
      the toxic spectrum of this chemical. The utilization of a protective agent
      against acrylamide toxicity was one of those strategies. To date, many agents
      with protective potency have been investigated. Herein, we compiled these agents 
      and their effects shown in in vitro studies. We used the search engines of Web of
      Knowledge and searched the keywords "acrylamide" and "protect" in the titles
      along with the keyword "cell" in the topics. Twenty-one directly related articles
      out of 35 articles were examined. Briefly, all agents used against acrylamide
      were reported to exhibit protective activity. In most of these reports, 5 mM
      concentration of acrylamide and 24-hour treatment were the employed dose and
      duration. Usually, the beneficial agents were pre-treated to the cells. PC12
      cells were the most utilized cell line, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase 
      (MAPK) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) pathways were the
      most studied pathways. This study, beside other importance, can be utilized as a 
      guide for how the protective studies against acrylamide were done and which
      parameters were investigated in in vitro acrylamide studies. In conclusion,
      taking measures is of utmost importance to prevent or alleviate the toxicity of
      acrylamide, to which we are daily exposed even in our homes. Therefore, future
      studies should persist in focusing on mitigating acrylamide toxicity.

TI  - A bibliometric of publication trends in medical image segmentation: Quantitative 
      and qualitative analysis.
PG  - 45-65
LID - 10.1002/acm2.13394 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Medical images are important in diagnosing disease and treatment
      planning. Computer algorithms that describe anatomical structures that highlight 
      regions of interest and remove unnecessary information are collectively known as 
      medical image segmentation algorithms. The quality of these algorithms will
      directly affect the performance of the following processing steps. There are many
      studies about the algorithms of medical image segmentation and their
      applications, but none involved a bibliometric of medical image segmentation.
      METHODS: This bibliometric work investigated the academic publication trends in
      medical image segmentation technology. These data were collected from the Web of 
      Science (WoS) Core Collection and the Scopus. In the quantitative analysis stage,
      important visual maps were produced to show publication trends from five
      different perspectives including annual publications, countries, top authors,
      publication sources, and keywords. In the qualitative analysis stage, the
      frequently used methods and research trends in the medical image segmentation
      field were analyzed from 49 publications with the top annual citation rates.
      RESULTS: The analysis results showed that the number of publications had
      increased rapidly by year. The top related countries include the Chinese
      mainland, the United States, and India. Most of these publications were
      conference papers, besides there are also some top journals. The research hotspot
      in this field was deep learning-based medical image segmentation algorithms based
      on keyword analysis. These publications were divided into three categories:
      reviews, segmentation algorithm publications, and other relevant publications.
      Among these three categories, segmentation algorithm publications occupied the
      vast majority, and deep learning neural network-based algorithm was the research 
      hotspots and frontiers. CONCLUSIONS: Through this bibliometric research work, the
      research hotspot in the medical image segmentation field is uncovered and can
      point to future research in the field. It can be expected that more researchers
      will focus their work on deep learning neural network-based medical image
      segmentation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: YouTube has become an important social media platform for teaching
      nursing skills. However, the content, reliability and quality levels of the
      videos on this platform are not adequately known. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to 
      evaluate the content, reliability and quality of YouTube videos on ventrogluteal 
      injection application. DESIGN: Descriptive. SETTINGS: Online. PARTICIPANTS: 26
      videos about ventrogluteal injection. METHODS: Videos were searched using the
      keyword "ventrogluteal injection". The content of the 26 videos meeting the
      inclusion criteria were evaluated using the "Ventrogluteal Intramuscular
      Injection Skill Form", the reliability with the "DISCERN Questionnaire", and the 
      quality levels using the "Global Quality Scale". The videos were categorized by
      their theme, type and upload source, and analysed statistically. RESULTS: Of the 
      26 videos meeting the inclusion criteria, 21 (80.8%) were classified as useful
      information, 5 (19.2%) as misleading information by theme, 22 (84.6%) as
      educational, 4 (15.4%) as hormone therapy by type, 5 (19.2%) as official
      institutions, 13 (50%) as individual by source of uploads. The content,
      reliability, quality score of useful videos were higher than misleading videos.
      There was a significant difference (p < 0.05) between reliability score and the
      source of video uploads. Pairwise comparisons indicated that there was no
      statistically significant difference (p > 0.05) between the source of uploads of 
      video and characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: The use of the examined YouTube videos in
      the training of injection into the ventrogluteal site appears to have various
      risks in terms of ethics and patient safety. It may be suggested that the
      injection videos should be prepared by competent institutions/individuals, using 
      best practice guides to increase the content, reliability and quality levels. It 
      should particularly be borne in mind that videos on hormone therapy can be a
      public health threat.

TI  - Cancer and severe mental illness in low- and middle-income countries: The
      challenges and outlook for the future.
PG  - 2002-2011
LID - 10.1002/pon.5796 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patients with severe mental illness (SMI) face health inequalities
      that lead to under treatment of diseases such as cancer and result in increased
      mortality. There is literature addressing this issue for SMI patients in
      high-income countries but few for those in low- and middle-income countries. This
      review aims to draw attention to the health inequalities and the compounding
      factors faced by SMI patients in low- and middle-income countries. The relevance 
      of integration of psycho-oncology in the care of SMI patients with cancer is
      integral to reduce disparities and address varied contributory factors. METHODS: 
      The literature review was conducted by searching through two databases which
      includes PubMed and Google Scholar. We searched for articles using keyword search
      terms: severe mental illness, SMI, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, cancer, low- 
      middle-income countries, low- and middle-income countries, psycho-oncology, HPV
      vaccine, cancer incidence, cancer mortality, cancer control, cancer screening,
      cancer treatment and palliative care. RESULTS: A total of 80 research articles
      were included in our literature review. We found that there was an increased
      requirement for adapting to the changing disease landscape in low- and
      middle-income countries. An improvement on aspects such as vaccination, screening
      and prevention is necessary, and also efforts to change social stance towards SMI
      is crucial. CONCLUSION: There is an increase incidence of cancer in low- and
      middle-income countries, and the number of patients with SMI in low- and
      middle-income countries is also rising. This is due to social, psychological,
      economical and healthcare factors. Low- and middle-income countries must consider
      improving these aspects in order to adapt to the changing landscape.

TI  - Methodological quality, guidance, and tools in scoping reviews: a scoping review 
      protocol.
LID - 10.11124/JBIES-20-00570 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this scoping review is to identify and report upon
      evidence (such as guidance) or tools regarding methodological quality or risk of 
      bias of scoping reviews. INTRODUCTION: Scoping reviews have gained popularity in 
      recent years but have been criticized for variations in their approaches. This
      scoping review will examine evidence on the methodological quality of scoping
      reviews, as well as identify and describe potential tools to inform the
      development of a tool for appraising the quality of scoping reviews. INCLUSION
      CRITERIA: The scoping review will include all documents reporting on the
      development, evaluation, or conduct of tools addressing the critical appraisal or
      risk of bias of scoping reviews. The literature search will seek evidence
      published from 2005 onwards, corresponding with the publication of Arksey and
      O'Malley's framework for scoping reviews. METHODS: The search strategy will aim
      to locate both published and unpublished documents utilizing a three-step search 
      strategy. An initial search of PubMed has identified keyword and MeSH terms. A
      second search of PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL will follow. Google and Google
      Scholar will be searched for difficult-to-locate and unpublished literature.
      Authors will endeavor to consult with relevant methodologists through the
      authors' professional networks, social media accounts, and professional
      newsletters to obtain materials that can be considered for inclusion. Documents
      will be independently screened, selected, and extracted by two researchers and
      the data will be presented in tables.

TI  - Advancing sustainable development goals through immunization: a literature
      review.
PG  - 95
LID - 10.1186/s12992-021-00745-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Immunization directly impacts health (SDG3) and brings a contribution
      to 14 out of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), such as ending poverty,
      reducing hunger, and reducing inequalities. Therefore, immunization is recognized
      to play a central role in reaching the SDGs, especially in low- and middle-income
      countries (LMICs). Despite continuous interventions to strengthen immunization
      systems and to adequately respond to emergency immunization during epidemics, the
      immunization-related indicators for SDG3 lag behind in sub-Saharan Africa.
      Especially taking into account the current Covid19 pandemic, the current
      performance on the connected SDGs is both a cause and a result of this. METHODS: 
      We conduct a literature review through a keyword search strategy complemented
      with handpicking and snowballing from earlier reviews. After title and abstract
      screening, we conducted a qualitative analysis of key insights and categorized
      them according to showing the impact of immunization on SDGs, sustainability
      challenges, and model-based solutions to these challenges. RESULTS: We reveal the
      leveraging mechanisms triggered by immunization and position them vis-a-vis the
      SDGs, within the framework of Public Health and Planetary Health. Several
      challenges for sustainable control of vaccine-preventable diseases are
      identified: access to immunization services, global vaccine availability to
      LMICs, context-dependent vaccine effectiveness, safe and affordable vaccines,
      local/regional vaccine production, public-private partnerships, and immunization 
      capacity/capability building. Model-based approaches that support SDG-promoting
      interventions concerning immunization systems are analyzed in light of the
      strategic priorities of the Immunization Agenda 2030. CONCLUSIONS: In general
      terms, it can be concluded that relevant future research requires (i) design for 
      system resilience, (ii) transdisciplinary modeling, (iii) connecting
      interventions in immunization with SDG outcomes, (iv) designing interventions and
      their implementation simultaneously, (v) offering tailored solutions, and (vi)
      model coordination and integration of services and partnerships. The research and
      health community is called upon to join forces to activate existing knowledge,
      generate new insights and develop decision-supporting tools for Low-and
      Middle-Income Countries' health authorities and communities to leverage
      immunization in its transformational role toward successfully meeting the SDGs in
      2030.

TI  - A Keyword Analysis Study on Postpartum Obesity Using Big Data.
LID - 8807 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18168807 [doi]
AB  - This study selected Google and Naver, the most recognizable Internet portals in
      Korea, as subjects for analysis. "Postpartum obesity" and "postpartum depression"
      were used as keywords for data collection. This study aimed to provide basic data
      for solving maternal problems using big data. Keywords related to postpartum
      obesity were collected from the portal site Google from 1 January 2019 to 31
      December 2019. The collected data were analyzed through simple frequency
      analysis, N-gram analysis, and keyword network. This study can be used as basic
      data for postpartum obesity-related programs or academic research. It is also
      expected to be used for research on the development of a mobile-based customized 
      healthcare system focused on maternal health. Previous papers and data are still 
      insufficient at solving the physical and mental problems related to postpartum
      obesity and depression. It is necessary to find ways to continuously integrate
      and collect data from mothers across the country.

TI  - A Comprehensive Review on Types, Methods and Different Regions Related to
      Water-Energy-Food Nexus.
LID - 8276 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18168276 [doi]
AB  - Water, food, and energy are three of the most important resources for long-term
      survival and development. The term "nexus" is used to underline the need of
      controlling these primary components collectively rather than separately because 
      they are interconnected and linked. With the purpose of better understanding
      nexus thinking and showcasing nexus analysis approaches and tools, this study
      explores the current state of the approach to the water-energy-food relationship,
      which has gotten a lot of attention in recent years. Water-energy, water-food,
      water-energy-food, water-energy, and climate are the four forms of nexus. This
      paper examines a variety of methodologies based on their principal objectives and
      provides a basic overview of a wide range of currently available methods and
      instruments for analyzing the water-energy-food (WEF) nexus. According to this
      study, the quantity of studies on the water-energy-food nexus has increased
      significantly, as the scientific community's ability to analyze water, food, and 
      energy interlinkages at a greater resolution. The integration and optimization of
      this multi-centric nexus is explored, with focus on four regions-Asia, Europe,
      America, and Africa-as a case study. The WEF nexus should be used in case studies
      to help illustrate its intricacies. Furthermore, this study builds a methodology 
      and frameworks to find study linkages between water, energy, food, and other
      components, for a nexus analysis and discuss the major challenges and its
      solutions. This study also includes a scientometric analysis that looks at the
      countries and keyword mapping. Furthermore, the study is being planned, with an
      emphasis on quantitative analysis of the water-energy-food nexus which is helpful
      for the water security at local and global scale. This study aids in the
      coordination of research efforts to solve the difficult issues in nexus research 
      and create sustainable and adaptable water, energy, and food systems.

TI  - Personalized and Self-Management: Systematic Search and Evaluation Quality
      Factors and User Preference of Drug Reference Apps in Taiwan.
LID - 790 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jpm11080790 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Drug reference apps promote self-management and improve the
      efficiency and quality of work for physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and patients.
      This study aimed to describe a systematic and stepwise process to identify drug
      reference apps in Taiwan, assess the quality of these apps, and analyze the
      influential factors for user ratings. METHODS: A two-step algorithm (KESS)
      consisting of keyword growing and systematic search was proposed. Seven
      independent reviewers were trained to evaluate these apps using Mobile App Rating
      Scale (MARS). A logistic regression model was fitted and average marginal effects
      (AME) were calculated to identify the effects of factors for higher user ratings.
      RESULTS: A total of 23 drug reference apps in Taiwan were identified and
      analyzed. Generally, these drug reference apps were evaluated as acceptable
      quality with an average MARS score of 3.23. Higher user engagement, more
      functionality, better aesthetics, and more information associated with higher
      user ratings. Navigation is the most influential factor on higher user ratings
      (AME: 13.15%) followed by performance (AME: 11.03%), visual appeal (AME: 10.87%),
      credibility (AME: 10.67%), and quantity of information (AME: 10.42%).
      CONCLUSIONS: User experience and information clearly affect user ratings of drug 
      reference apps. Five key factors should be considered when designing drug
      reference apps.

TI  - Novel Insights into the Molecular Regulation of Ribonucleotide Reductase in
      Adrenocortical Carcinoma Treatment.
LID - 4200 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/cancers13164200 [doi]
AB  - Current systemic treatment options for patients with adrenocortical carcinomas
      (ACCs) are far from being satisfactory. DNA damage/repair mechanisms, which
      involve, e.g., ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) and
      ataxia-telangiectasia/Rad3-related (ATR) protein signaling or ribonucleotide
      reductase subunits M1/M2 (RRM1/RRM2)-encoded ribonucleotide reductase (RNR)
      activation, commonly contribute to drug resistance. Moreover, the regulation of
      RRM2b, the p53-induced alternative to RRM2, is of unclear importance for ACC.
      Upon extensive drug screening, including a large panel of chemotherapies and
      molecular targeted inhibitors, we provide strong evidence for the anti-tumoral
      efficacy of combined gemcitabine (G) and cisplatin (C) treatment against the
      adrenocortical cell lines NCI-H295R and MUC-1. However, accompanying induction of
      RRM1, RRM2, and RRM2b expression also indicated developing G resistance, a
      frequent side effect in clinical patient care. Interestingly, this effect was
      partially reversed upon addition of C. We confirmed our findings for RRM2
      protein, RNR-dependent dATP levels, and modulations of related ATM/ATR signaling.
      Finally, we screened for complementing inhibitors of the DNA damage/repair system
      targeting RNR, Wee1, CHK1/2, ATR, and ATM. Notably, the combination of G, C, and 
      the dual RRM1/RRM2 inhibitor COH29 resulted in previously unreached total cell
      killing. In summary, we provide evidence that RNR-modulating therapies might
      represent a new therapeutic option for ACC.

TI  - Clinical Applications and Factors Involved in Validating Thermal Windows Used in 
      Infrared Thermography in Cattle and River Buffalo to Assess Health and
      Productivity.
LID - 2247 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani11082247 [doi]
AB  - Infrared thermography (IRT) is a non-ionizing, non-invasive technique that
      permits evaluating the comfort levels of animals, a topic of concern due to the
      growing interest in determining the state of health and welfare of production
      animals. The operating principle of IRT is detecting the heat irradiated in
      anatomical regions characterized by a high density of near-surface blood vessels 
      that can regulate temperature gain or loss from/to the environment by modifying
      blood flow. This is essential for understanding the various vascular
      thermoregulation mechanisms of different species, such as rodents and ruminants' 
      tails. The usefulness of ocular, nasal, and vulvar thermal windows in the orbital
      (regio orbitalis), nasal (regio nasalis), and urogenital (regio urogenitalis)
      regions, respectively, has been demonstrated in cattle. However, recent evidence 
      for the river buffalo has detected discrepancies in the data gathered from
      distinct thermal regions in these large ruminants, suggesting a limited
      sensitivity and specificity when used with this species due to various factors:
      the presence of hair, ambient temperature, and anatomical features, such as skin 
      thickness and variations in blood supplies to different regions. In this review, 
      a literature search was conducted in Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and
      PubMed, using keyword combinations that included "infrared thermography", "water 
      buffalo", "river buffalo" "thermoregulation", "microvascular changes", "lacrimal 
      caruncle", "udder", "mastitis", and "nostril". We discuss recent findings on four
      thermal windows-the orbital and nasal regions, mammary gland in the udder region 
      (regio uberis), and vulvar in the urogenital region (regio urogenitalis)-to
      elucidate the factors that modulate and intervene in validating thermal windows
      and interpreting the information they provide, as it relates to the clinical
      usefulness of IRT for cattle (Bos) and the river buffalo (Bubalus bubalis).

TI  - Behavioural economics in fisheries: A systematic review protocol.
PG  - e0255333
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0255333 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The field of behavioural economics holds several opportunities for
      integrated fisheries management and conservation and can help researchers and
      managers alike understand fisher behaviour and decision-making. As the study of
      the cognitive biases that influence decision-making processes, behavioural
      economics differentiates itself from the classical field of economics in that it 
      does not assume strictly rational behaviour of its agents, but rather looks for
      all mechanisms that influence behaviour. This field offers potential applications
      for fisheries management, for example in relation to behavioural change, but such
      applications require evidence of these mechanisms applied in a fisheries context.
      Thus, we have developed a systematic literature review protocol focusing on the
      primary question: "Which behavioural economics mechanisms influence fisher
      behaviour?" The aim is to provide a comprehensive overview of these different
      mechanisms and how they have been applied in the study of fisher behaviour.
      METHODS AND EXPECTED OUTPUTS: The review protocol was developed in close
      collaboration with the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea
      (ICES) Working Group on Maritime Systems (WGMARS). WGMARS members were therefore 
      considered the key stakeholders for this study, and were consulted to develop a
      suitable systematic review question and methodology. Three academic databases
      will be searched using a customized Boolean keyword search string. Research
      articles deemed eligible for inclusion in the systematic review are those that
      studied the influence of behavioural-economics mechanisms on the behaviour of
      marine fishers in any location, and at any scale. Insights from this literature
      will be collated in order to provide an overview of the relevant
      behavioural-economics mechanisms and actions, how effective these mechanisms are 
      and at what scale, geographic region and in which fisheries sector they have been
      applied. Any fisheries management implications identified by the studies under
      review will also be outlined. Finally, it will be recorded whether or not ethical
      considerations were made in the reviewed literature, so that in the discussion it
      will be possible to reflect on the ethics of conducting behavioural-economics
      research and policy actions in a fisheries context.

      CrystalFeel algorithm: a cross-sectional study.
PG  - 418
LID - 10.1186/s12903-021-01778-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reasons such as the lack of information on the COVID-19 disease, lack
      of proven treatment for it, uncertainty about the duration of the pandemic, or
      social isolation affect people's mental health. This study aimed to analyze the
      emotional type and intensity in tweets on toothache posted during the COVID-19
      pandemic. METHODS: Using the Twitter Search API, we collected tweets in English
      associated with the keywords "Corona, Toothache" "Corona, Tooth, Pain" "Corona,
      Dental Pain" "Covid-19, Toothache" "Covid-19, Tooth, Pain" and "Covid-19, Dental 
      Pain" posted between March 11, 2020 and June 30, 2020 all around the world. After
      the relevant inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, 426 posts were
      selected and analyzed using the CrystalFeel algorithm, a sensitivity analytical
      technology with proven accuracy. The chi-square test (SPSS v23, IBM) was used to 
      compare emotions and emotional intensities according to the words used. RESULTS: 
      It was determined that 80.3% of the participants experienced fear and 61.7% had a
      negative emotional intensity. There was no statistically significant difference
      between the distributions of emotions according to the words without time
      distinction (p = 0.136). There was a statistically significant difference between
      the distributions of emotional intensity according to the words without time
      distinction (p = 0.006). The keyword "Corona, Toothache" was used the most
      frequently by 30.8% of the participants. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to 
      analyze the emotional reactions of individuals who experienced toothaches during 
      the COVID-19 pandemic using the CrystalFeel algorithm. Monitoring the social
      media posts of individuals experiencing toothache during the pandemic will help
      reduce fear and anger emotions and design public information messages that are
      compatible with the target group's needs.

      implantology: a bibliometric analysis.
PG  - 1122
LID - 10.21037/atm-21-726 [doi]
AB  - Background: Periodontal disease is a leading cause of tooth loss, and microRNA
      (miRNA) has been shown to regulate various biological processes. This study aimed
      to quantitatively analyze the literature related to miRNA in periodontology and
      dental implantology and summarize the research hotspots and trends in this field.
      Methods: Literature records from 1985 to 2020 were obtained from the Web of
      Science Core Collection database. After manual selection, the data was used for
      cooperative network analysis, keyword co-occurrence analysis, and reference
      co-citation analysis and visualized by CiteSpace. Results: A total of 287 papers 
      were analyzed between 2007 and 2020, and more than 95% of them were published in 
      the past decade. The largest number of publications were from China, followed by 
      the USA and Japan. The direct cooperation among the productive institutions was
      not close. At present, most of the research belongs to the discipline of
      dentistry, oral surgery, cell biology, and molecular biology. Literature clusters
      generated by reference co-citation analysis and keyword co-occurrence network
      showed that previous studies mainly focused on four hotspots: periodontal
      ligament stem cells (PDLSCs), the pathological process of periodontitis,
      osteogenic differentiation/bone regeneration, and the competing endogenous RNA
      (ceRNA) network. Conclusions: The therapeutic potential of miRNA in promoting
      bone formation and how the ceRNA network contributes to miRNA regulation at a
      deeper level have become the two main research trends of this field.

TI  - The development of a machine learning algorithm to identify occupational injuries
      in agriculture using pre-hospital care reports.
PG  - 31
LID - 10.1007/s13755-021-00161-9 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Current injury surveillance efforts in agriculture are considerably
      hampered by the limited quantity of occupation or industry data in current health
      records. This has impeded efforts to develop more accurate injury burden
      estimates and has negatively impacted the prioritization of workplace health and 
      safety in state and federal public health efforts. This paper describes the
      development of a Naive Bayes machine learning algorithm to identify occupational 
      injuries in agriculture using existing administrative data, specifically in
      pre-hospital care reports (PCR). Methods: A Naive Bayes machine learning
      algorithm was trained on PCR datasets from 2008-2010 from Maine and New Hampshire
      and tested on newer data from those states between 2011 and 2016. Further
      analyses were devoted to establishing the generalizability of the model across
      various states and various years. Dual visual inspection was used to verify the
      records subset by the algorithm. Results: The Naive Bayes machine learning
      algorithm reduced the volume of cases that required visual inspection by 69.5
      percent over a keyword search strategy alone. Coders identified 341 true
      agricultural injury records (Case class = 1) (Maine 2011-2016, New Hampshire
      2011-2015). In addition, there were 581 (Case class = 2 or 3) that were suspected
      to be agricultural acute/traumatic events, but lacked the necessary detail to
      make a certain distinction. Conclusions: The application of the trained algorithm
      on newer data reduced the volume of records requiring visual inspection by two
      thirds over the previous keyword search strategy, making it a sustainable and
      cost-effective way to understand injury trends in agriculture.

TI  - Themes and trends for osteoporosis: the bibliometric and altmetric approach.
PG  - 122
LID - 10.1007/s11657-021-00983-w [doi]
AB  - Our aim is to evaluate and compare the most discussed articles on osteoporosis in
      academia and social media. The treatment of osteoporosis was the most popular
      topic in the top 100 citation (n = 31) and altmetric lists (n = 47). The general 
      public, as well as academia, is curious about the treatment of osteoporosis.
      PURPOSE: The main aim of this study is to investigate the trends in the field of 
      osteoporosis and guide researchers by conducting bibliometric and altmetric
      analysis for osteoporosis with the most cited and discussed articles on social
      media. METHODS: The keyword "osteoporosis" was searched from the Web of Science
      All Databases and Altmetric.com website, and the top 100 (T100) citation and
      altmetric list was created, respectively. The T100 citation and altmetric list
      articles were analyzed and compared in terms of study type, topic of study, first
      author, publication year, citation number, journal quartile in category, impact
      factor, and Altmetric Attention Score (AAS). RESULTS: T100 cited articles: the
      median for citation number was 1117 (range: 717-3854) and the median for AAS was 
      9 (range: 0-371). T100 altmetric articles: the AAS median was 158 (range: 93-658)
      and citation number median was 31 (range: 0-2132). Only 6 articles were the same 
      in both lists. The number of articles about treatment was 31 in the T100 citation
      list and 47 in the T100 altmetric list. The most ranked journals were "The New
      England Journal of Medicine" with 22 articles in the T100 citation list and
      "Osteoporosis International" with 16 articles in the T100 altmetric list.
      CONCLUSION: Unlike the citation number, one of the greatest contributions of AAS 
      to researchers may be developing appropriate policies in the field of
      osteoporosis according to the interests of the society.

AB  - Objective: To identify and evaluate the indexed studies that allow us to
      understand the implications of imaging studies in MRI and PET/CT related to
      COVID-19 research. Methods: Scoping review. Articles in PubMed, Scopus, and Web
      of Science (WoS) were scanned from 2019 to 2021 with COVID-19, MRI, and PET-CT as
      keywords. EndNote software and manual checking removed the duplicated references.
      Our assessment includes citation, bibliometric, keyword network, and statistical 
      analyses using descriptive statistics and correlations. Highlighted variables
      were publication year, country, journals, and authorship. Results: Only 326
      papers were included. The most cited article reached 669 cites; this number
      represented 21.71% of 3081 citations. The top-15 cited authors received 1787
      citations, which represented 58% of the total cites. These authors had
      affiliations from ten countries (Belgium, China, France, Italy, Japan, Spain,
      Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom (UK), and the USA). The top-30 journals were cited
      2762 times, representing 89.65% of the total cites. Only five journals were cited
      more than 100 times; Int J Infect Dis had the most significant number of
      citations (674). Some of the unexpected keywords were encephalitis, stroke,
      microbleeds, myocarditis. Conclusion: COVID-19 pandemic is still spreading
      worldwide, and the knowledge about its different facets continues advancing. MRI 
      and PET/CT are being used in more than 50% of the selected studies; research
      trends span seven categories, no only the diagnostic but others like
      socio-economic impact and pathogenesis Developed countries had an advantage by
      having hospitals with more resources, including MRI and PET/CT facilities in the 
      same institution to supplement basic assessment in patients with COVID-19.

AB  - AIM: To analyze the intellectual structure and recent research trends in diabetic
      retinopathy (DR) and unearth potential knowledge. METHODS: English DR publication
      included in this study was exported from the Web of Science Core Collection, and 
      Chinese DR publication was exported from China National Knowledge Infrastructure 
      from the establishment time of the database to 2019. CiteSpace and Microsoft
      Excel were used to visually analyze DR research, including analysis of the number
      of publications, highly cited publication analysis, spatial distribution
      analysis, and keyword co-occurrence analysis. RESULTS: A total of 23 795 English 
      studies and 11 577 Chinese studies, including 2089 studies related to traditional
      Chinese medicine (TCM), were obtained. The data suggested the following: 1) The
      number of English and Chinese DR publications increased over time, and the growth
      rate of English publications was relatively fast. 2) The distribution of
      international scholars and institutions was close, while the distribution was
      scattered in China. Shanghai Jiao Tong University has the largest number of
      publications. Tien-Yin Wong was the core author with the largest number of
      publications. England and the United States are the core of international DR
      research cooperation. 3) Optical coherence tomography and risk factors are recent
      international research hot spots and trends. The difference is that TCM is a
      recent research trend under DR in China. CONCLUSION: DR has drawn an increasing
      amount of attention worldwide. The focus of research in this field has shifted
      from tertiary type DR treatment to secondary prevention strategies which focus on
      the screening and monitoring of disease progression. The advantages of TCM in the
      prevention of DR have attracted attention, and it is worth incorporating this
      with Western medicine to address this challenge.

AB  - Many cities worldwide are using re-greening strategies to help reverse
      urbanization patterns that aggravate environmental issues. Green infrastructure
      (GI) has become a significant and effective strategy to address environmental
      problems. To better understand GI, this study uses CiteSpace to analyze 5420
      published papers in the field of GI on the Web of Science database from
      1990-2020. This bibliometric analysis will help new scholars and researchers to
      better understand the current status and trends in GI research, as well as
      identify further research needed in the field. This study evaluated research on
      GI trends according to publication amounts, keywords, journals, disciplines,
      countries, institutions, and authors. Results show that, first, GI research has
      experienced rapid growth since 2014. Second, GI, ecosystem services, and city are
      the top three keywords related to GI research, with green roof as the keyword
      with the strongest linkage. Third, Sustainability, Urban Forestry and Urban
      Greening, and Landscape and Urban Planning are the top three journals publishing 
      GI research. Fourth, the top three disciplines researching GI are environmental
      science, engineering, and science and technology. Fifth, the USA is the top
      ranked country in terms of the number of published GI-related papers (1514
      papers), followed by China (730 papers) and England (546 papers). Sixth, the US
      Environmental Protection Agency (84 papers) is the top institution in terms of
      publications, followed by the Chinese Academy of Science (83 papers) and the
      Swedish University of Agriculture (66 papers). Finally, D. Haase has the most
      published articles (29 papers), followed by S. Pauleit (28 papers) and P.
      Angelstam (26 papers). These findings indicate that GI has developed
      significantly in the last 30 years, with a high probability for increased growth 
      in the future.

TI  - Using Nonword Repetition to Identify Developmental Language Disorder in
      Monolingual and Bilingual Children: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 3578-3593
LID - 10.1044/2021_JSLHR-20-00552 [doi]
AB  - Purpose A wealth of studies has assessed the diagnostic value of the nonword
      repetition task (NWRT) for the detection of developmental language disorder (DLD)
      in the clinical context of speech and language therapy, first in monolingual
      children and, more recently, in bilingual children. This review article reviews
      this literature systematically and conducts a meta-analysis on the discriminative
      power of this type of task in both populations. Method Three databases were used 
      to select articles based on keyword combinations, which were then reviewed for
      relevance and methodological rigor based on internationally recognized
      checklists. From an initial pool of 488 studies, 46 studies were selected for
      inclusion in the systematic review, and 35 of these studies could be included in 
      a meta-analysis. Results Most of the articles report significant discrimination
      between children with and without DLD in both monolingual and bilingual contexts,
      and the meta-analysis shows a large mean effect size. Three factors (age of the
      child, linguistic status, and language specificity of the task) yielded enough
      quantitative data for further exploration. Subgroups analysis shows variance in
      effect sizes, but none of the three factors, neither their interactions, were
      significant in a metaregression. We discuss how other, less explored factors
      (e.g., nature of the stimuli, scoring methods) could also contribute to
      differences in results. Sensitivity and specificity analyses reported in 33
      studies confirmed that, despite possible effect size differences, the diagnostic 
      accuracy of the NWRT is generally near thresholds considered to be
      discriminatory. It generally increases when it is combined with other tasks
      (e.g., parental questionnaire). Conclusions This review indicates that the NWRT
      is a promising diagnostic tool to identify children with DLD in monolingual and
      bilingual contexts with a large mean effect size. However, it seems necessary to 
      choose the precise NWRT materials based on the children's language background and
      to complement the assessment sessions with other tools in order to ensure
      diagnosis and to obtain complete language profile of the child. Supplemental

      studies of rapid-acting antidepressants.

AB  - Depression is frequently associated with sleep problems, and clinical improvement
      often coincides with the normalization of sleep architecture and realignment of
      circadian rhythm. The effectiveness of treatments targeting sleep in depressed
      patients, such as sleep deprivation, further demonstrates the confluence of sleep
      and mood. Moreover, recent studies showing that the rapid-acting antidepressant
      ketamine influences processes related to sleep-wake neurobiology have led to
      novel hypotheses explaining rapid and sustained antidepressant effects. Despite
      the available evidence, studies addressing ketamine's antidepressant effects have
      focused on pharmacology and often overlooked the role of physiology. To explore
      this discrepancy in research on rapid-acting antidepressants, we examined
      articles published between 2009-2019. A keyword search algorithm indicated that
      vast majority of the articles completely ignored sleep. Out of the 100 most
      frequently cited preclinical and clinical research papers, 89 % and 71 %,
      respectively, did not mention sleep at all. Furthermore, only a handful of these 
      articles disclosed key experimental variables, such as the times of treatment
      administration or behavioral testing, let alone considered the potential
      association between these variables and experimental observations. Notably, in
      preclinical studies, treatments were preferentially administered during the
      inactive period, which is the polar opposite of clinical practice and research.
      We discuss the potential impact of this practice on the results in the field. Our
      hope is that this perspective will serve as a wake-up call to (re)-examine
      rapid-acting antidepressant effects with more appreciation for the role of sleep 
      and chronobiology.

TI  - Health halo or genuine product development: Are better-for-you alcohol products
      actually healthier?
LID - 10.1002/hpja.531 [doi]
AB  - ISSUE ADDRESSED: Alcoholic products marketed as better-for-you is an emerging
      trend in Australia that has received limited research attention to date. This
      study aimed to examine the nutrient profiles of alcoholic products marketed as
      better-for-you that are available in the Australian market. METHODS: We extracted
      the details of alcoholic product announcements published on the Drinks Trade
      website in 2019 and 2020 containing at least one keyword used to promote
      better-for-you products. The alcohol, energy, carbohydrate and sugar content of
      each product was recorded and assessed against existing classifications for
      alcohol strength and sugar and carbohydrate content. RESULTS: We identified 144
      products promoted as better-for-you. The majority of products (85%, n = 122) were
      classified as full-strength, and the median alcohol content across each alcohol
      product category was classified as full-strength. Most of the energy content came
      from alcohol, with 62% of products deriving at least 75% of their energy content 
      from alcohol. CONCLUSIONS: Alcoholic products marketed as better-for-you appear
      to rely on an illusion of healthfulness, without addressing the ingredient of
      most concern to health, the alcohol content. SO WHAT?: Controls on alcohol
      marketing should be expanded to limit the use of health and nutrient claims.
      Mandatory labelling of alcoholic products with nutrition information would
      support consumers to be better informed about the contents of alcoholic products.

TI  - Diabetes self-management education interventions in the WHO African Region: A
      scoping review.
PG  - e0256123
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0256123 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the commonest chronic diseases
      worldwide. Self-Management Education (SME) is regarded as a critical element of
      treatment for all people with diabetes, as well as those at risk of developing
      the condition. While a great variety of diabetes self-management education (DSME)
      interventions are available in high-income countries, limited information exists 
      on educational programs for the prevention and management of diabetes
      complications in Africa. This study, therefore, aimed at synthesizing information
      in the literature to describe the state of the science of DSME interventions in
      the WHO African Region. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study is a scoping review,
      which followed the standard PRISMA guidelines for conducting and reporting
      scoping reviews. A systematic keyword and subject headings searches were
      conducted on six electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO
      and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) to identify relevant
      English language publications on DSME from 2000 through 2020. Titles and
      abstracts of the search results were screened to select eligible papers for full 
      text reading. All eligible papers were retrieved and full text screening was done
      by three independent reviewers to select studies for inclusion in the final
      analysis. RESULTS: Nineteen studies were included in the review. The
      interventions identified were individually oriented, group-based, individually
      oriented & group-based, and information technology-based DSME programs. Outcomes 
      of the interventions were mixed. While the majority yielded significant positive 
      results on HbA1c, diabetes knowledge, blood pressure, blood sugar and foot care
      practices; few demonstrated positive outcomes on self-efficacy, BMI, physical
      activity; self-monitoring of blood glucose, medication adherence, smoking and
      alcohol consumption. CONCLUSIONS: The limited studies available indicate that
      DSME interventions in the WHO African Region have mixed effects on patient
      behaviors and health outcomes. That notwithstanding, the majority of the
      interventions demonstrated statistically significant positive effects on HbA1c,
      the main outcome measure in most DSME intervention studies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore publicly available information about the self-removal of
      long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) on a popular video-sharing website.
      STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a comprehensive keyword search of YouTube videos
      related to self-removal of LARC-namely intrauterine devices and implants. We
      analyzed video content to explore demographic characteristics, method and
      duration of LARC use, and motivations and experiences of self-removal. RESULTS:
      Our keyword search identified 58 videos that met the criteria for inclusion,
      including 48 videos that featured individuals who removed an intrauterine device 
      and 10 who removed an implant. Collectively, videos had over 4 million views. We 
      identified most video creators as white (53%), 31% as Black, and 14% as Latinx.
      Users were motivated to remove their own device by both preferences and barriers 
      to formal care. Most individuals in our sample (n = 56/58) successfully removed
      their device and described their experience in positive terms related to the ease
      of removal. Reasons for LARC discontinuation included negative side effects, fear
      of potential side effects, and desire for pregnancy. CONCLUSION: This study
      builds upon prior research by describing publicly available information about
      LARC self-removal. The over representation of Black women in our sample may
      reflect a higher prevalence of LARC self-removal among this population. Positive 
      experiences of self-removal and high levels of viewer engagement with online
      videos suggest a need for provider counseling on LARC removal at the time of
      insertion. IMPLICATIONS: Prior to LARC insertion, patients should be made aware
      of any financial requirements for discontinuation. Provider counseling for
      self-removal at the time of insertion will likely minimize health risks and
      affirm patient reproductive autonomy.

TI  - Efficacy of carboprost tromethamine combined with leonurus japonicus for
      prevention of postpartum hemorrhage in high-risk pregnant women: A protocol for
      systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - e26792
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000026792 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: No well-designed and systematic evaluation of the efficacy and safety
      of leonurus japonicus injection (LJI) in combination with carboprost tromethamine
      has been found. Therefore, we undertook a meta-analysis to assess the efficacy
      and safety of carboprost tromethamine combined with LJI for the prevention of
      postpartum hemorrhage in high-risk pregnant women to provide new evidence-based
      medical evidence for clinical treatment. METHODS: This systematic review and
      meta-analysis would be performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for
      Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The following databases
      including EMBASE, MEDICINE, Wanfang, China National Knowledge Infrastructure
      database, and Cochrane central controlled trial registries were searched by 2
      reviewers from inception to July 2021. Mesh and keyword search terms were
      "motherwort," "Yimucao," "leonurus japonicas," "carboprost tromethamine," and
      "postpartum hemorrhage." Any cohort studies that assessed the efficacy and safety
      of carboprost tromethamine combined with LJI for the prevention of postpartum
      hemorrhage would be included. P < .05 was set as the level of significance.
      RESULTS: The review would add to the existing literature by showing compelling
      evidence and improved guidance in clinic settings. OSF REGISTRATION NUMBER:

PG  - e650
LID - 10.7717/peerj-cs.650 [doi]
AB  - The success of supervised learning techniques for automatic speech processing
      does not always extend to problems with limited annotated speech. Unsupervised
      representation learning aims at utilizing unlabelled data to learn a
      transformation that makes speech easily distinguishable for classification tasks,
      whereby deep auto-encoder variants have been most successful in finding such
      representations. This paper proposes a novel mechanism to incorporate geometric
      position of speech samples within the global structure of an unlabelled feature
      set. Regression to the geometric position is also added as an additional
      constraint for the representation learning auto-encoder. The representation
      learnt by the proposed model has been evaluated over a supervised classification 
      task for limited vocabulary keyword spotting, with the proposed representation
      outperforming the commonly used cepstral features by about 9% in terms of
      classification accuracy, despite using a limited amount of labels during
      supervision. Furthermore, a small keyword dataset has been collected for Kadazan,
      an indigenous, low-resourced Southeast Asian language. Analysis for the Kadazan
      dataset also confirms the superiority of the proposed representation for limited 
      annotation. The results are significant as they confirm that the proposed method 
      can learn unsupervised speech representations effectively for classification
      tasks with scarce labelled data.

TI  - Collaboration between the government and nongovernmental organizations in
      providing health-care services: A systematic review of challenges.
PG  - 242
LID - 10.4103/jehp.jehp_1312_20 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Given the expanding range of health influencing factors, increasing
      expectations from the health systems, and general challenges such as insufficient
      resources, the health services needed by people cannot be provided completely by 
      the governments alone. Therefore, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)-government
      collaboration is considered a common approach in health-care provision for
      different communities. Since the NGO-government collaboration is complicated and 
      usually influenced by many challenges and issues, the present study was conducted
      to identify collaboration challenges between the government and NGOs in providing
      health-care services. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a systematic review method and
      searching in ISI Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, and Embase databases, using
      related keyword/terms, between March 2020 and June 2020, studies on
      NGO-government collaboration in the health area were collected without time
      limitation. After completing the article selection process, those articles that
      consistent with the research purpose were chosen for the final analysis. RESULTS:
      From 4236 initially collected studies, 16 studies were chosen for the final
      analysis. Based on the content analysis of the selected articles, 70 challenges
      were identified in the NGO-government collaboration to provide health-care
      services. These challenges were divided into five main themes: structural issues,
      process issues, issues related to roles and responsibilities, trust and
      communications issues, and control and power relation issues and 11 subthemes.
      CONCLUSION: The present study provides significant challenges by NGO-government
      collaboration in providing health-care services. Awareness of these challenges
      plays an important role in promoting such collaborations and enables these
      organizations to highly exploit the strengths of each other, resulting in a
      collaboration with win-win situation.

TI  - Research trends in trabecular bone score: A bibliometric review from 2008 to
      2019.
PG  - 307-313
LID - 10.4103/tcmj.tcmj_256_20 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Trabecular bone score (TBS) is a novel index for assessing bone
      microarchitecture quality. No bibliometric reviews to date have yet explored the 
      literature of TBS. Therefore, this study aimed to provide a bibliometric review
      on the trends of research publications on TBS indexed in the Science Citation
      Index Expanded and the Social Sciences Citation Index from 2008 to 2019.
      Materials and Methods: Using the Science Citation Index Expanded and the Social
      Sciences Citation Index, articles designated as original articles or review
      articles were searched using the keyword "trabecular bone score." The retrieved
      articles were analyzed using Histcite 12.03.17 and VOSviewer v. 1.6.15 to
      identify top authors, journals, countries, and occurrence of keywords. Results: A
      total of 430 original and review articles on TBS published between 2008 and 2019 
      were identified. The number of articles increased steadily from 2008 to 2019,
      reaching 80 articles in 2019 alone. The United States of America, Switzerland,
      and France were the countries with the highest output of publications. The
      journal Osteoporosis International published the largest number of articles on
      TBS. Analysis of co-occurrence of author-supplied keywords revealed four
      clusters, with TBS, bone mineral density, and osteoporosis as the most prominent 
      keywords. Conclusion: This bibliometric study on TBS published between 2008 and
      2019 revealed the collaborative network of countries and the highly published
      journals and authors. Co-occurrence of keywords also revealed clusters of
      research hotspots, which could contribute to the understanding of the current
      state of TBS research and the identification of research gap.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have suggested an association between vegetarian diet
      and higher depression scores. However, some studies have also shown an effect in 
      the opposite direction, indicating lower depression scores in vegetarians. Given 
      this discrepancy in the literature, this meta-analysis was aimed to determine
      whether there is a significant association between vegetarian diet and depression
      scores across different published studies. METHODS: A keyword search in major
      databases was conducted. Studies reporting depression scores in vegetarians and a
      non-vegetarian control group were included. Meta-analysis following a conditional
      random-effects procedure was conducted in R. RESULTS: After duplicates were
      removed and studies were analyzed for inclusion criteria, k=13 studies with an
      overall n of 49889 participants (8057 vegetarians and 41832 non-vegetarian
      controls) were included in the analysis. Random-effects meta-analysis revealed a 
      significant difference between vegetarians and non-vegetarians, with vegetarians 
      showing higher depression scores than non-vegetarians. LIMITATIONS: The
      heterogeneity between studies was high and geographical variation in study
      location was low, limiting cross-cultural insights. CONCLUSIONS: Vegetarians show
      higher depression scores than non-vegetarians. However, due to high heterogeneity
      of published studies, more empirical research is needed before any final
      conclusions can be drawn. Also, empirical studies from a higher number of
      different countries would be desirable.

TI  - Graphene and Iron Reinforced Polymer Composite Electromagnetic Shielding
      Applications: A Review.
LID - 2580 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/polym13152580 [doi]
AB  - With advancements in the automated industry, electromagnetic inferences (EMI)
      have been increasing over time, causing major distress among the end-users and
      affecting electronic appliances. The issue is not new and major work has been
      done, but unfortunately, the issue has not been fully eliminated. Therefore, this
      review intends to evaluate the previous carried-out studies on electromagnetic
      shielding materials with the combination of Graphene@Iron, Graphene@Polymer,
      Iron@Polymer and Graphene@Iron@Polymer composites in X-band frequency range and
      above to deal with EMI. VOSviewer was also used to perform the keyword analysis
      which shows how the studies are interconnected. Based on the carried-out review
      it was observed that the most preferable materials to deal with EMI are
      polymer-based composites which showed remarkable results. It is because the
      polymers are flexible and provide better bonding with other materials.
      Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), polyaniline (PANI), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)
      and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) are effective in the X-band frequency range,
      and PDMS, epoxy, PVDF and PANI provide good shielding effectiveness above the
      X-band frequency range. However, still, many new combinations need to be examined
      as mostly the shielding effectiveness was achieved within the X-band frequency
      range where much work is required in the higher frequency range.

TI  - Lesson learned from an international training program on patients medication
      adherence for healthcare professionals.
PG  - 137-143
AB  - SUMMARY: Objective. Healthcare professionals play a crucial role for promoting
      medication adherence in older adults. This research aimed to assess changes in
      professionals' opinions about medication adherence after attending a course,
      collecting suggestions for future educational programs. Method. A one-week course
      on medication adherence in older adults was held involving 32 healthcare
      professionals and students from Italy, Portugal and Poland as part of the
      Erasmus+ Skills4Adherence Project. Prior to and at the end of the course,
      participants provided three keyword answers through a Google Form. Responses were
      collectively discussed and commented on. Results. At the end of the course a
      general tendency to put more attention on patient's beliefs and engagement was
      revealed. The caregivers' role was also underlined. As to suggestions for
      education, three keywords were considered not enough to characterize adherence
      issues. Conversely, professionals considered collective discussions and
      roleplaying to be effective for increasing awareness on this theme. Discussion
      and conclusion. Several changes in healthcare professionals' opinions regarding
      determinants of medicationadherence were revealed after this dedicated course.
      Overall, multidisciplinary and practical training programs should be proposed for
      increasing healthcare professionals' awareness of factors impacting on medication
      adherence in older adults.

TI  - Ambiguous "olfactory" terms for anatomic spaces adjacent to the cribriform plate:
      A publication database analysis and quest for uniformity.
PG  - 1186-1195
LID - 10.1002/ca.23771 [doi]
AB  - A precise nomenclature and terminology is the foundation of communication in
      Anatomy and related biomedical sciences. The olfactory bulbs and nerves lie above
      and below the cribriform plate (CP), respectively. Hence, many anatomical
      landmarks in this region have names adopting the term "olfactory" as qualifiers. 
      Ambiguous use of these "olfactory" terms exists, with some potential
      repercussions on patient treatments. We performed a publication database analysis
      to determine the frequency of misuse of names for seven anatomical "olfactory"
      spaces close to the CP and nasal cavity. We searched PubMed(R) publications
      having the keyword "olfactory" in their title or abstract, plus one of seven
      other keywords: "groove", "fossa", "recess", "cleft", "vestibule", "sulcus", and 
      "cistern". We reviewed all abstracts for accuracy of these terms relative to
      accepted norms or customary definitions. By February 2020, we found all these
      keywords in 1255 articles. For the terms olfactory "groove" and "fossa", the
      number of relevant articles (and percentage of those inaccurately using these
      terms) were 374 (1.1%), and 49 (8.2%), respectively. All 52 abstracts containing 
      "olfactory" and "vestibule" were irrelevant, relating to the "nasal vestibule"
      and olfactory function, instead of "olfactory vestibule". Overall, terms used to 
      describe "olfactory" spaces near the CP are seldom ambiguous or inaccurate, but
      the terms olfactory "groove" and "fossa" are occasionally misused, We propose
      several new "olfactory" terms for inclusion in the Terminologia Anatomica, and
      stress the need for uniform nomenclature leading to greater consistency and
      accuracy in clinical use of anatomical terms containing the word "olfactory" as a
      descriptor.

LID - 10.1002/cpz1.217 [doi]
AB  - PubChem (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) is a public chemical database that
      serves scientific communities as well as the general public. This database
      collects chemical information from hundreds of data sources and organizes them
      into multiple data collections, including Substance, Compound, BioAssay, Protein,
      Gene, Pathway, and Patent. These collections are interlinked with each other,
      allowing users to discover related records in the various collections (e.g.,
      drugs targeting a protein or genes modulated by a chemical). PubChem can be
      searched by keyword (e.g., a chemical, protein, or gene name) as well as by
      chemical structure. The input structure can be provided using popular line
      notations or drawn with the PubChem Sketcher. PubChem supports various types of
      structure searches, including identity search, 2-D and 3-D similarity searches,
      and substructure and superstructure searches. Results from multiple searches can 
      be combined using Boolean operators (i.e., AND, OR, and NOT) to formulate complex
      queries. PubChem allows the user to quickly retrieve a list of records annotated 
      with a particular classification or ontological term. This paper provides
      step-by-step instructions on how to explore PubChem data with examples of
      commonly requested tasks. (c) 2021. This article is a U.S. Government work and is

TI  - The Impact of THC and CBD in Schizophrenia: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 694394
LID - 10.3389/fpsyt.2021.694394 [doi]
AB  - Background: People with schizophrenia are more likely to develop cannabis use
      disorder (CUD) and experience worse outcomes with use. Yet as cannabis is
      legalized for medical and recreational use, there is interest in its therapeutic 
      potential. Objectives: To conduct a systematic review summarizing the design and 
      results of controlled trials using defined doses of THC and CBD in schizophrenia.
      Method: A keyword search of eight online literature databases identified 11
      eligible reports. Results: One placebo controlled trial (13 stable patients
      without CUD) found that intravenous THC increased psychosis and worsened
      learning/recall. Two reports of a functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) study of
      smoked or oral THC in 12 abstinent patients with schizophrenia and CUD found no
      change in symptoms and cognition, and an amelioration of impaired resting state
      brain function in areas implicated in reward function and the default mode
      network. One 4 week trial in acutely psychotic inpatients without CUD (mean age
      30 y) found 800 mg CBD to be similarly efficacious to amisupride in improving
      psychosis and cognition. Two 6 week studies of CBD augmentation of antipsychotics
      in stable outpatients reported mixed results: CBD 600 mg was not more effective
      than placebo; CBD 1,000 mg reduced symptoms in a sample that did not exclude
      cannabis use and CUD. A brain fMRI and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy
      study of single dose CBD in a sample that did not exclude CUD and cannabis use
      found that CBD improved symptoms and brain function during a learning/recall task
      and was associated with increased hippocampal glutamate. Discussion: There is
      substantial heterogeneity across studies in dose, method of drug delivery, length
      of treatment, patient age, whether patients with cannabis use/CUD were included
      or excluded, and whether patients were using antipsychotic medication.
      Conclusion: There is insufficient evidence for an effect of THC or CBD on
      symptoms, cognition, and neuroimaging measures of brain function in
      schizophrenia. At this time, research does not support recommending medical
      cannabis (THC or CBD) for treating patients with schizophrenia. Further research 
      should examine THC and CBD in schizophrenia with and without comorbid CUD and
      consider the role of CBD in mitigating symptom exacerbation from THC.

AB  - Environmental communication (EC) is of great significance to the practice of
      environmental protection by human society, as it involves disseminating
      ecological and environmental information, communicating environmental risks, and 
      increasing environmental awareness among the audience. In this study, knowledge
      mapping analysis was used to systematically review research in the field of EC. A
      scientometric analysis (1900-2020) was carried out on 2219 journal articles
      obtained from the Web of Science database to explore the basic characteristics,
      research hotspots, and research frontiers of EC research. The results revealed
      that: (1) Research on EC received widespread attention since the beginning of the
      21st century, and 2010 was an important turning point in the study of EC. EC
      research shows the trend of interdisciplinary development. (2) Well-known
      universities in western countries and from around the world constitute the main
      body of current EC research. However, there is still a lack of international
      cooperation in the field of EC research. (3) Climate change, as a complex
      scientific issue, is not only a global environmental issue, but also the most
      concerned and hot issue in the field of EC. It has a strong political attribute
      and has become a major issue that cannot be ignored in politics. (4) According to
      the timeline analysis of research hotspots, EC research was innovatively divided 
      into an initial stage, a development stage, and a rising stage. Combined the
      keyword bursts result with the research hotspots analysis, the research frontier 
      of EC was divided into four periods. Finally, the shortcomings of this study are 
      summarized and directions for future research of EC are proposed by considering
      the following four aspects: research perspective, research content, research
      paradigm and method, and research context.

TI  - Evaluation of YouTube as an information source for denture care.
LID - S0022-3913(21)00364-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.prosdent.2021.06.045 [doi]
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Denture cleaning is indispensable to the maintenance of
      good oral and systemic health for denture users. Nowadays people often consult
      YouTube about health-related topics, including denture care. However, the quality
      of the information about denture care presented on YouTube is unknown. PURPOSE:
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness and quality of popular
      videos about denture care shared by different uploaders on YouTube and to
      evaluate the demographic characteristics of the videos. MATERIAL AND METHODS:
      Google Trends showed that "denture cleaning" was the most searched keyword on the
      topic. This keyword was used to search YouTube videos. Of the 200 most-watched
      videos, 109 videos were selected for analysis. Included videos were analyzed for 
      their demographic data, including number of views; number of likes, dislikes, and
      comments; days since upload; duration and number of subscribers; an 8-point
      usefulness score system, a global quality scale (GQS); video sources; target
      groups; and primary purposes of the videos. Statistical analyses were conducted
      by using the Kruskal-Wallis test, post hoc Mann-Whitney U test, Pearson
      chi-squared test, and Spearman correlation analysis, which was used to
      investigate the relationship among total content score, GQS score, and video
      demographics. Cohen kappa statistics was used to measure the reliability of the
      investigator's evaluations of the videos (alpha=.05). RESULTS: Based on the
      usefulness score, 59.6% of the videos were classified as poor, 32.1% as moderate,
      and 8.2% as good. No statistically significant differences were found among
      usefulness scores according to the video demographics, except lower GQS score of 
      poor content videos (P<.001). The overall mean +/-standard deviation GQS score
      was 1.92 +/-1.0 out of 5. Videos were primarily uploaded (38.5%) from commercial 
      companies. No statistically significant difference was found between video
      sources and usefulness scores (P>.05). The number of videos with poor content was
      significantly higher than the number with moderate and good content among the
      videos primarily intended for the education of health professionals (P<.001).
      CONCLUSIONS: The majority (59.6%) of YouTube videos on denture care received poor
      content quality ratings, independent of video demographics. Therefore, YouTube is
      not suitable as the only source of information on denture care. Dentists and
      prosthodontists should take more responsibility for enriching the content of
      video-sharing platforms because this content can affect the behavior of patients 
      and their attitudes about denture care.

TI  - A Bibliometric Analysis on Nonpoint Source Pollution: Current Status,
      Development, and Future.
LID - 7723 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18157723 [doi]
AB  - Nonpoint source pollution (NPS) has become the leading factor of global water
      quality problems, attracting great attention from governments and researchers in 
      various countries. Based on this situation, understanding the current research
      status of NPS can help guide future research. However, most of the current
      reviews only describe the research status of some specific aspects but fail to
      quantify the research hotspots and development trends on the whole, which limits 
      the overall understanding of NPS. In this paper, bibliometrics was used to study 
      the current status, hotspots, and frontiers of NPS research during 1991-2015, and
      the future research development was predicted. Over the past 15 years, there has 
      been a remarkable growth trend in publication output, and the participation of
      countries/territories has also increased. Journal of Environmental Quality,
      Journal of Hydrology, and Total Environmental Science were the top three
      journals. Sharpley AN and Arnold JG from the USA were the most productive authors
      with the best quality articles. The major author clusters and research regions
      are located in North America and Europe, followed by East Asia. The United States
      dominates this research field, with the largest number of independent and
      collaborative articles. Chinese authors gained more attention through
      international cooperation. Keyword analysis confirmed that water quality and
      nutrients were the main concerns of NPS pollution research, which mainly involved
      a number of research topics, such as pollutant emission reduction research and
      the evaluation and simulation of pollutants' migration and their transformation
      under different situations, while pesticides were less of a concern, which
      suggests that the abuse of pesticides has come under control. Meanwhile, SWAT was
      the dominating model in the last decade partly because it satisfied the growing
      needs of watershed-scale management.

TI  - Dietary Fatty Acids at the Crossroad between Obesity and Colorectal Cancer: Fine 
      Regulators of Adipose Tissue Homeostasis and Immune Response.
LID - 1738 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/cells10071738 [doi]
AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the major threatening diseases worldwide, being 
      the third most common cancer, and a leading cause of death, with a global
      incidence expected to increase in the coming years. Enhanced adiposity,
      particularly visceral fat, is a major risk factor for the development of several 
      tumours, including CRC, and represents an important indicator of incidence,
      survival, prognosis, recurrence rates, and response to therapy. The
      obesity-associated low-grade chronic inflammation is thought to be a key
      determinant in CRC development, with the adipocytes and the adipose tissue (AT)
      playing a significant role in the integration of diet-related endocrine,
      metabolic, and inflammatory signals. Furthermore, AT infiltrating immune cells
      contribute to local and systemic inflammation by affecting immune and cancer cell
      functions through the release of soluble mediators. Among the factors introduced 
      with diet and enriched in AT, fatty acids (FA) represent major players in
      inflammation and are able to deeply regulate AT homeostasis and immune cell
      function through gene expression regulation and by modulating the activity of
      several transcription factors (TF). This review summarizes human studies on the
      effects of dietary FA on AT homeostasis and immune cell functions, highlighting
      the molecular pathways and TF involved. The relevance of FA balance in linking
      diet, AT inflammation, and CRC is also discussed. Original and review articles
      were searched in PubMed without temporal limitation up to March 2021, by using
      fatty acid as a keyword in combination with diet, obesity, colorectal cancer,
      inflammation, adipose tissue, immune cells, and transcription factors.

TI  - Bibliometric analysis of the research landscape on rice husks gasification
      (1995-2019).
PG  - 49467-49490
LID - 10.1007/s11356-021-15761-x [doi]
AB  - The processing of rice (Oryza sativa L.) generates large quantities of
      lignocellulosic wastes termed rice husks (RH). Numerous researchers have proposed
      biomass gasification as the panacea to the waste disposal and management
      challenges posed by RH. However, a comprehensive analysis of RH gasification is
      required to examine the research landscape and future directions on the area. The
      research landscape and global developments on RH gasification from 1995 to 2019
      are examined through bibliometric analysis of 228 publications extracted from the
      Web of Science. Bioresource Technology is considered the most influential journal
      on the topic, whereas China is the most productive nation due to government
      policies and research funding. The most productive organization is the Harbin
      Institute of Technology, which is due to the significant contributions of Zhao
      YiJun and co-workers. Keyword analysis revealed three crucial research themes:
      gasification, biomass, and rice husks. The literature revealed that the syngas
      yield, distribution, and performance of RH gasification are significantly
      influenced by temperature, equivalence ratio, selected reactor, and gasifying
      medium. The techno-economic analysis of RH gasification revealed that government 
      interventions such as high sales rates and low investment costs could enhance the
      commercial viability of the technology. Furthermore, the integration of RH
      gasification with carbon capture utilization and storage could promote the
      decarbonization of power plants, negative emissions, and net-zero climate goals. 
      Overall, the paper provides valuable information for future researchers to
      identify strategic collaborators, journal publications, and research frontiers
      yet unexplored.

TI  - Always-On Sub-Microwatt Spiking Neural Network Based on Spike-Driven Clock- and
      Power-Gating for an Ultra-Low-Power Intelligent Device.
PG  - 684113
LID - 10.3389/fnins.2021.684113 [doi]
AB  - This paper presents a novel spiking neural network (SNN) classifier architecture 
      for enabling always-on artificial intelligent (AI) functions, such as keyword
      spotting (KWS) and visual wake-up, in ultra-low-power internet-of-things (IoT)
      devices. Such always-on hardware tends to dominate the power efficiency of an IoT
      device and therefore it is paramount to minimize its power dissipation. A key
      observation is that the input signal to always-on hardware is typically sparse in
      time. This is a great opportunity that a SNN classifier can leverage because the 
      switching activity and the power consumption of SNN hardware can scale with spike
      rate. To leverage this scalability, the proposed SNN classifier architecture
      employs event-driven architecture, especially fine-grained clock generation and
      gating and fine-grained power gating, to obtain very low static power
      dissipation. The prototype is fabricated in 65 nm CMOS and occupies an area of
      1.99 mm(2). At 0.52 V supply voltage, it consumes 75 nW at no input activity and 
      less than 300 nW at 100% input activity. It still maintains competitive inference
      accuracy for KWS and other always-on classification workloads. The prototype
      achieved a power consumption reduction of over three orders of magnitude compared
      to the state-of-the-art for SNN hardware and of about 2.3X compared to the
      state-of-the-art KWS hardware.

TI  - Procalcitonin in general internal medicine: a bibliometric analysis.
PG  - 8203-8214
LID - 10.21037/apm-21-1689 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Procalcitonin (PCT) plays an important role in the identification of 
      bacterial infection and therapy guidance. The relevant literature is mainly
      classified under critical care medicine or infectious disease. The research
      status of PCT in general internal medicine (GIM) is currently unclear. This
      research aimed to analyze PCT-related literature in the GIM field and provide
      references for future research. METHODS: A subject search strategy was used for
      the term PCT, with the search scope limited to Medicine, General & Internal. We
      conducted a search of relevant literature in the Science Citation Index Expanded 
      (SCIE) database in the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC), with no
      publication date limit (1900 to May 16, 2021, the date of the final search for
      this study). The search results were analyzed using CiteSpace software to assess 
      the status of PCT research in the GIM field based on annual paper publication
      numbers, the number of citations, country distribution, institution distribution,
      author distribution, journal distribution, and keyword usage. RESULTS: A total of
      905 document records were retrieved. Articles were mainly from Europe, the United
      States, and China, and the number of citations totaled 15,917. There were 5
      research institutions that published more than 10 related papers and 3 authors
      who published more than 10 papers. There was little cooperation between authors
      from different countries and institutions. This field should focus on leading
      journals in critical care medicine and quality comprehensive journals. Keyword
      analysis showed that the current research focus is the standardized application
      of PCT. CONCLUSIONS: There are few targeted studies on the application of PCT in 
      GIM, and the relevant important literature mainly comes from other journals.
      GIM-specific research should be increased in the future.

TI  - Prodromal Symptoms in Depression: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 365-372
LID - 10.1159/000517953 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Appraisal of prodromal symptoms of unipolar depression may
      complement the traditional cross-sectional approach and provide a longitudinal
      perspective, according to a staging model of the illness. OBJECTIVE: To provide
      an updated systematic review of clinical studies concerned with prodromal
      symptoms of unipolar depression, according to PRISMA guidelines. METHODS: Keyword
      searches were conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Longitudinal
      studies on prodromal symptoms and signs in adult patients primarily diagnosed
      with unipolar depression were selected. Findings were examined separately
      according to study design (i.e., retrospective or prospective). RESULTS:
      Twenty-five studies met the criteria for inclusion in this systematic review.
      Findings indicate that a distinct prodromal symptomatology - commonly
      characterized by anxiety, tension, irritability, and somatic complaints - exists 
      before the onset of unipolar depression. The duration of the prodromal phase was 
      highly variable across studies, ranging from less than a month to several years. 
      Prodromal symptoms profile and duration were consistent within individuals across
      depressive episodes. There was a close relationship between prodromal and
      residual symptoms of the same depressive episode. CONCLUSIONS: The present
      systematic review addresses an important, and yet relatively neglected, clinical 
      issue that deserves further investigation and may be of immediate practical
      value. The findings provide challenging insights into the pathogenesis and course
      of unipolar depression, which may result in more timely and effective treatment
      of recurrences. The definition of a prodromal phase in depression would benefit
      from the joint use of symptom identification, biomarkers, and neuroimaging.

TI  - Frequency of Social Media and Digital Scholarship Keywords in U.S. Medical
      Schools' Promotion and Tenure Guidelines.
LID - 10.1097/ACM.0000000000004324 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Medical schools must have clear policies and procedures for promotion
      and tenure (P&T) of faculty. Social media and digital scholarship (SMDS) is an
      emerging form of scholarship capable of reaching audiences quickly, conveniently,
      and in a wide variety of formats. It is unclear how frequently SMDS is considered
      during P&T reviews. The authors sought to determine whether current P&T
      guidelines at medical schools consider SMDS. METHOD: The authors acquired P&T
      guidelines from any U.S. Liaison Committee on Medical Education-accredited
      medical school (or their governing university) that were available online between
      October and December 2020. Using an iterative process, they developed a bank of
      keywords that were specific to SMDS or that could include SMDS between October
      and December 2020. The authors searched each school's guidelines for each keyword
      and determined whether the word was being used in relation to crediting faculty
      for SMDS in the context of P&T procedures. The primary outcome measure was the
      dichotomous presence or absence of SMDS-specific keywords in each school's P&T
      guidelines. RESULTS: The authors acquired P&T guidelines from 145/154 (94%)
      medical schools. After removing duplicate documents, the authors considered 139
      guidelines. The keyword bank included 59 terms, of which 49 were specific to SMDS
      and 10 were umbrella terms that could be inclusive of SMDS. Of the 139
      guidelines, 121 (87%) contained at least one SMDS-specific keyword. Schools had a
      median of 3 SMDS-specific keywords in their P&T guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: As the
      presence and impact of SMDS increases, schools should provide guidance on its
      role in the P&T process. Faculty should receive clear guidance on how to document
      quality SMDS for their promotion file.

TI  - Is YouTube a high-quality source of information on cancer rehabilitation?
LID - 10.1007/s11764-021-01093-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Searching for information on the Internet, especially YouTube(TM), is
      gaining popularity for cancer survivors. Based on the topic of online health
      information, the importance of studies using YouTube data for various cancer
      types and treatment methods has increased. This study aims to investigate the
      quality, reliability, and accuracy of YouTube videos on cancer rehabilitation
      (CR). METHODS: YouTube search was performed on February 26th, 2021, with two
      keyword sets: "cancer rehabilitation" and "oncology rehabilitation." The modified
      DISCERN, the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) scoring system,
      and the Global Quality Score (GQS) were used to evaluate the quality and
      reliability of the videos. The features of each video such as the number of
      likes, dislikes, and views, upload date, duration, like ratio, and the uploader
      profile were also collected. RESULTS: Fifty-three of the first 200 videos shown
      in the search results met the criteria. Most of the videos were low quality. The 
      most common uploader profile was academic institute/university hospital. The
      three most common subjects in the videos were CR definition, physical therapy and
      occupational therapy, and patient experiences. The mean modified DISCERN, JAMA,
      and GQS scores were 2.14, 2.03, and 2.78, respectively. Higher quality videos had
      longer duration, greater number of views, and better reliability scores.
      CONCLUSION: The results showed that most of the rated videos were of low-quality 
      and didn't provide sufficient information on the topic discussed. Higher-quality 
      and more accurate YouTube videos are needed to increase awareness of CR.
      IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: For cancer survivors, CR-related YouTube video
      content often provides information of low reliability. In this context, it is
      necessary to focus on the production of video content that includes clinical
      guides, references, and are based on clinical-based practices.

TI  - Functions and Outcomes of Personal Health Records for Patients with Chronic
      Diseases: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 1l
AB  - Introduction: The personal health record (PHR) makes it possible for patients to 
      access, manage, track, and share their health information. By engaging patients
      in chronic disease care, they will be active members in decision-making and
      healthcare management. Objectives: This study aimed to identify the functions and
      outcomes of PHR for patients with four major groups of chronic diseases
      (cardiovascular diseases, cancers, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases).
      Method: A systematic review was conducted on studies published in PubMed, Scopus,
      Web of Science, and Embase. Searching and screening were performed using the
      keyword of "Personal Health Record" without time limitation, and ended in August 
      2018. Results: In total, 3742 studies were retrieved, 35 of which met the
      inclusion criteria. Out of these 35, 18 studies were conducted in the United
      States, 24 studies were related to patients with diabetes, and 32 studies focused
      on tethered PHRs. Moreover, in 25 studies, the function of viewing and reading
      medical records and personal health information was provided for three groups of 
      chronic patients. Results showed that the use of PHRs helps the management and
      control of chronic diseases (10 studies). Conclusion: It is recommended that
      integrated PHRs with comprehensive functions and features were designed in order 
      to support patient independence and empowerment in self-management, decrease the 
      number of referrals to health centers, and reduce the costs imposed on families
      and society.

TI  - The aesthetic, artistic and creative contributions of dance for health and
      wellbeing across the lifecourse: a systematic review.
PG  - 1950891
LID - 10.1080/17482631.2021.1950891 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This review articulates current understanding of the aesthetic, artistic
      and creative contributions that Dance makes to Health and Wellbeing across the
      lifecourse within publications 2000-2019, an under-researched area. METHODS:
      Review Questions: What are the aesthetic, artistic and creative contributions
      that Dance makes to Health and Wellbeing across the lifecourse? And what
      methodologies are appropriate for investigating these contributions? A database
      keyword search identified 769 articles and 91 evaluations. 109 documents were
      identified for further in-depth analysis and rating, resulting in 24 papers (11
      articles, 3 PhD studies, 10 evaluation reports), which were thematically
      analysed. RESULTS: Findings offer seven interrelated contributions that Dance
      makes to Health and Wellbeing: embodiment, identity, belonging, self-worth,
      aesthetics, affective responses and creativity. There was less insight regarding 
      different methodologies, and discussions focused on quantitative data's
      limitations. There were insights into inclusion of embodied voices, subjective
      accounts, and lived experiences. CONCLUSION: Whilst acknowledging challenges,
      this paper illuminates the key contributions of dance to arts and health. It
      provides a future conceptual research agenda (prioritizing identity and
      creativity) and associated methodological developments. It recommends expanding
      geographical/lifecourse research, better defining terms, fuller epistemological
      critiques to open space for new methodologies, and continued attendance to
      appropriate rigour criteria.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a choronic, complex and powerfully inherited mental illness that
      seriously affects quality of life. The illness is one of the most researched
      psychiatric disorders from past to present. This study aims to provide a holistic
      summary of the global scientific outputs through bibliometric analyses and reveal
      the trend topics. The articles published between the years 1975 and 2020 were
      downloaded from the Web of Science (WoS) database and analyzed using bibliometric
      methods. The literature review was conducted using the keyword ''schizophren*''
      in the ''Research Area'' category. The relation between the number of
      publications of the countries and the Gross Domestic Products and Human
      Development Index values were analyzed using Spearman's correlation coefficient. 
      The number of articles between the years 2021 and 2032 was estimated through
      linear regression analysis.There were 103,992 publications, 51,117 of which were 
      articles. The number of studies has increased in direct proportion to the
      development level of the countries. Schizophrenia Research was the most active
      journal. The most used research topics are cognition, negative symptoms, bipolar 
      disorder, antipsychotics, depression, clozapine, quality of life. Trend keywords 
      used in recent years are 'inflammation', 'biomarker', 'oxidative stress', 'Brain 
      Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)', 'social cognition', 'metacognition',
      'motivation', 'social functioning', 'functioning', 'mental health', 'metabolic
      syndrome', 'functional connectivity', 'adherence' and 'recovery' indicated new
      research frontiers in this field. Although schizophrenia has not been fully
      elucidated, studies are growing like an avalanche. Our study includes the most
      up-to-date and most comprehensive data ever made in this field.

      The aim of the current study was to describe quantitively the history of
      inventions for strength training equipment. Content analysis was conducted of
      patent applications for strength training equipment filed with the U.S. Patent
      and Trademark Office before 1980. Applications were identified using relevant
      keyword searches in Google Patents. A total of 551 patent applications were
      analyzed. The earliest application identified was filed in 1860. Applications
      never exceed 6 per year until 1961 after which applications increased
      substantially, with a peak of 54 in 1979. Men invented 98.7% of all strength
      training devices. Lloyd J. Lambert, Jr. was the most prolific inventor, with 10
      inventions. Types of inventions included mobile units (34.5%), stationary
      machines (27.9%), dumbbells (16%), racks or benches (8.0%), barbells (6.7%), and 
      Indian clubs (3.8%). Common features included seats or benches (18.7%),
      cable-pulley systems (15.1%), weight stacks (8.2%), weight trays (4.5%), and cams
      (2.2%). Common types of resistance included weights or plates (33.2%), springs
      (11.6%), friction (9.1%), elastic bands (5.3%), and hydraulic (3.8%). Proposed
      invention benefits included adjustable resistance (37.4%), inexpensive (36.1%),
      simple to use (32.8%), compact design or easy storage (27.0%), multiple exercise 
      options (26.1%), safety and comfort (25.4%), effectiveness (23.6%), portability
      (20.5%), adjustable size (15.8%), sturdiness or durability (15.8%), home use
      (13.6%), and light weight (13.6%). Certain aspects of strength training equipment
      have evolved over time. However, overall purposes and benefits of inventions have
      remained constant (e.g., affordability, convenience, personalization, safety, and
      effectiveness).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Microtia is a congenital auricular malformation with a hypoplastic
      external ear that ranges in severity from a slightly smaller auricle to complete 
      the absence of the auricle. The present study was conducted to identify and
      analyze the characteristics of microtia-related articles published from 2006 to
      2020 by using bibliometric analyses. METHOD: Microtia-related studies published
      from 2006 to 2020 were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection
      database. Keywords, first author, citations, date of publication, and publication
      journal were extracted and quantitatively analyzed using Bibliographic Item
      Co-Occurrence Matrix Builder software and the Bibliometric
      (https://bibliometric.com/app). VOSviewer was used to visualize research and form
      a network map on keywords and citations. RESULTS: A total of 1031 articles from
      2006 to 2020 were included. The number of articles showed an overall trend of
      growth over time. The United States and China are the top 2 countries in terms of
      the number of microtia-related articles. From the analysis of keyword clustering,
      keywords could be mainly divided into 4 clusters in the field of microtia
      research: surgery, tissue engineering, epidemiology, and rehabilitation including
      hearing-related treatments, evaluation of effects, and quality of life after
      surgery. The top 10 most frequently cited papers from 2006 to 2020 were also
      extracted and analyzed. CONCLUSION: A bibliometric research of microtia-related
      articles from 2006 to 2020 was conducted. This study may be helpful to understand
      the current research status of microtia and find the research trends in this
      field, thus proposing future directions for microtia research.

TI  - Unjust: the health records of youth with personal/family justice involvement in a
      large pediatric health system.
PG  - 20
LID - 10.1186/s40352-021-00147-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mass incarceration has had an undeniable toll on childhood poverty
      and inequality, however, little is known about the consequences on pediatric
      health. The purpose of this study was to identify and describe the health of
      pediatric patients with probable personal or family history involvement with the 
      correctional system. METHODS: A descriptive study was conducted using electronic 
      health record data of 2.3 million youth (ages 0-21 years) who received care in a 
      large Midwestern hospital-based institution from February 2006-2020. We employed 
      a correctional-related keyword search (e.g. jail, prison, probation, parole) to
      locate youth with probable personal or family history involvement. Health
      characteristics were measured as clinician diagnostic codes. RESULTS: Two percent
      of the total pediatric population had a correctional keyword in the medical chart
      (N = 51,855). This 2% made up 66% of all patients with cannabis-related
      diagnoses, 52% of all patients with trauma-related diagnoses, 48% of all
      stress-related diagnoses, 38% of all patients with psychotic disorder diagnoses, 
      and 33% of all suicidal-related disorders within this institution's electronic
      health record database - among other highly concerning findings. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      captured an alarming health profile that warrants further investigation and
      validation methods to better address the gaps in our clinical understanding of
      youth with personal or family history involvement with the correctional system.
      We can do better in identifying, and supporting families affected by the
      correctional system.

TI  - Research trends of platelet-rich plasma application in orthopaedics from 2002 to 
      2020: a bibliometric analysis.
PG  - 2773-2790
LID - 10.1007/s00264-021-05163-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has been widely used to treat various
      orthopaedic diseases, and there are a large number of studies on the matter.
      However, there have been no bibliometric reports on the publications in this
      field. Bibliometrics is an excellent method to systematically evaluate the
      current research status of a specific field. In this study, CiteSpace 5.7.R2
      software was used to analyse the status, hotspots, and frontiers of PRP in the
      treatment of orthopaedic diseases in the past 19 years. METHODS: All articles
      about the application of PRP in orthopaedics from 2002 to 2020 were searched from
      the Web of Science Core Collection. The author, country, institution, journal,
      cited journal, and keywords were retrieved, and the bibliometric analysis was
      done in CiteSpace 5.7.R2. RESULTS: A total of 321 articles were retrieved. The
      analysis showed that the number of publications increased in the past 19 years,
      and the most productive author in this field was Brian J. Cole. The most
      productive country and the most productive institution were the US and the
      Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, respectively. The journals with the
      highest output and the highest citation frequency were the Journal of Orthopaedic
      Research and the American Journal of Sports Medicine, respectively. From the
      keyword analysis, we observed that the primary research hotspots were the study
      of the PRP composition, growth factors, and the combination of PRP and
      mesenchymal stem cells. The frontiers of PRP were in vivo experiments, the
      treatment of rotator cuff and cartilage injury, and the comparison of clinical
      efficacy between PRP and hyaluronic acid. CONCLUSION: The efficacy of PRP in
      treating orthopaedic diseases remains controversial. There are still some
      problems with the experimental methods, such as insufficient sample size, low
      level of evidence, confusion of system naming, lack of standardisation of
      preparation methods and application programs, and lack of in-depth basic
      scientific research. The research status shown by co-occurrence and cluster maps 
      and the analysis of hotspots and frontiers may help solve present problems and
      explore new directions.

TI  - Genistein: An Integrative Overview of Its Mode of Action, Pharmacological
      Properties, and Health Benefits.
PG  - 3268136
LID - 10.1155/2021/3268136 [doi]
AB  - Genistein is an isoflavone first isolated from the brooming plant Dyer's Genista 
      tinctoria L. and is widely distributed in the Fabaceae family. As an isoflavone, 
      mammalian genistein exerts estrogen-like functions. Several biological effects of
      genistein have been reported in preclinical studies, such as the antioxidant,
      anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antiviral activities, the effects of
      angiogenesis and estrogen, and the pharmacological activities on diabetes and
      lipid metabolism. The purpose of this review is to provide up-to-date evidence of
      preclinical pharmacological activities with mechanisms of action,
      bioavailability, and clinical evidence of genistein. The literature was
      researched using the most important keyword "genistein" from the PubMed, Science,
      and Google Scholar databases, and the taxonomy was validated using The Plant
      List. Data were also collected from specialized books and other online resources.
      The main positive effects of genistein refer to the protection against
      cardiovascular diseases and to the decrease of the incidence of some types of
      cancer, especially breast cancer. Although the mechanism of protection against
      cancer involves several aspects of genistein metabolism, the researchers
      attribute this effect to the similarity between the structure of soy genistein
      and that of estrogen. This structural similarity allows genistein to displace
      estrogen from cellular receptors, thus blocking their hormonal activity. The
      pharmacological activities resulting from the experimental studies of this review
      support the traditional uses of genistein, but in the future, further
      investigations are needed on the efficacy, safety, and use of nanotechnologies to
      increase bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy.

TI  - Evaluation of Endoscopic Practices and Outcomes in Follow-up of Gastric Ulcers.
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0000000000001595 [doi]
AB  - GOAL: The aim of this study was to evaluate current practice in gastric ulcer
      follow-up to establish diagnostic yield and predictors of malignancy. BACKGROUND:
      Repeat gastroscopy is routinely performed to confirm gastric ulcer healing and
      exclude malignancy. However, the incidence of malignancy at follow-up endoscopy
      is low, without consensus regarding case selection and timing. STUDY: New gastric
      ulcers diagnosed on gastroscopy at 2 institutions in Australia were identified
      through keyword search of endoscopy reports over a 5-year period (2013 to 2017). 
      Data collected included patient demographics, clinical presentation, and
      endoscopic and histologic findings from initial and subsequent gastroscopies.
      RESULTS: Of 795 patients, repeat gastroscopy was performed in 440 (55%).
      Malignancy was diagnosed in 52 (7%) with 83% identified at initial gastroscopy.
      Eight cancers were identified at repeat gastroscopy with malignancy yield of 2%
      (8/440). Three were diagnosed in patients with benign initial ulcer histology
      (3/286, 1%). One cancer was diagnosed during follow-up in a patient with benign
      histology but no repeat gastroscopy (1/286, 0.3%). Predictors of benign ulcers
      were absence of endoscopic suspicion [odds ratio (OR) 0.1 (0.03-0.13),
      P</=0.005], complete healing on repeat gastroscopy [OR 0.5 (0.34-0.70), P=0.036] 
      and benign initial histology [OR 0.12 (0.43-0.90), P</=0.005]. CONCLUSIONS: Seven
      percent of new gastric ulcers were malignant with most identified with biopsy on 
      initial gastroscopy. Malignancy yield from follow-up gastroscopy was 2%.
      Diagnostic yield of endoscopic follow-up may be low in ulcers with benign
      appearance and adequate histology. However, current practice of repeat
      gastroscopy is warranted in the absence of patient-based and lesion-based
      predictors of malignancy.

TI  - Wound healing properties of flavonoids: A systematic review highlighting the
      mechanisms of action.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Flavonoids are a class of compounds with a wide variety of biological
      functions, being an important source of new products with pharmaceutical
      potential, including treatment of skin wounds. PURPOSE: This review aimed to
      summarize and evaluate the evidence in the literature in respect of the healing
      properties of flavonoids on skin wounds in animal models. STUDY DESIGN: This is a
      systematic review following the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for
      Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. METHODS: This was
      carried out through a specialized search of four databases: PubMed, Scopus, Web
      of Science and Embase. The following keyword combinations were used:
      "flavonoidal" OR "flavonoid" OR "flavonoidic" OR "flavonoids" AND "wound healing"
      as well as MeSH terms, Emtree terms and free-text words. RESULTS: Fifty-five (55)
      articles met the established inclusion and exclusion criteria. Flavonoids
      presented effects in respect of the inflammatory process, angiogenesis,
      re-epithelialization and oxidative stress. They were shown to be able to act on
      macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells by mediating the release and
      expression of TGF-beta1, VEGF, Ang, Tie, Smad 2 and 3, and IL-10. Moreover, they 
      were able to reduce the release of inflammatory cytokines, NFkappaB, ROS and the 
      M1 phenotype. Flavonoids acted by positively regulating MMPs 2, 8, 9 and 13, and 
      the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK, PI3K/Akt and NO pathways. CONCLUSION: Flavonoids are useful 
      tools in the development of therapies to treat skin lesions, and our review
      provides a scientific basis for future basic and translational research.

TI  - Differences in information accessed in a pharmacologic knowledge base using a
      conversational agent vs traditional search methods.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Clinicians rely on pharmacologic knowledge bases to answer
      medication questions and avoid potential adverse drug events. In late 2018, an
      artificial intelligence-based conversational agent, Watson Assistant (WA), was
      made available to online subscribers to the pharmacologic knowledge base,
      Micromedex(R). WA allows users to ask medication-related questions in natural
      language. This study evaluated search method-dependent differences in the
      frequency of information accessed by traditional methods (keyword search and
      heading navigation) vs conversational agent search. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We
      compared the proportion of information types accessed through the conversational 
      agent to the proportion of analogous information types accessed by traditional
      methods during the first 6 months of 2020. RESULTS: Addition of the
      conversational agent allowed early adopters to access 22 different information
      types contained in the 'quick answers' portion of the knowledge base. These
      information types were accessed 117,550 times with WA during the study period,
      compared to 33,649,651 times using traditional search methods. The distribution
      across information types differed by method employed (c(2) test, P < .0001).
      Single drug/dosing, FDA/non-FDA uses, adverse effects, and drug administration
      emerged as 4 of the top 5 information types accessed by either method.
      Intravenous compatibility was accessed more frequently using the conversational
      agent (7.7% vs. 0.6% for traditional methods), whereas dose adjustments were
      accessed more frequently via traditional methods (4.8% vs. 1.4% for WA).
      CONCLUSION: In a widely used pharmacologic knowledge base, information accessed
      through conversational agents versus traditional methods differed. User-centered 
      studies are needed to understand these differences.

TI  - Frequent Eczematous Dermatitis in Unrelated Cord Blood Hematopoietic Cell
      Transplant Recipients Compared With Other Donor Types.

AB  - We have consistently noticed in our clinical practice eczematous dermatitis (EcD)
      without other pathologic findings of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in
      recipients of unrelated cord blood transplantation (CBT). We hypothesized that
      the incidence of EcD was higher in CBT compared with other donor types, and our
      objective in this study was to compare the frequency, clinical course, and
      response to therapy of EcD between CBT and non-CBT recipients. We conducted a
      retrospective study of 720 consecutive adult recipients of allogeneic
      hematopoietic cell transplants from 2010 to 2016 from any donor type and with
      follow-up for at least 1 year after transplantation. After using keyword-based
      automated scanning to identify "eczema," "dermatitis," or "spongiosis" terms in
      medical records, we retrieved 217 cases for manual record review. We identified
      23 EcD cases (12 in CBT recipients and 11 in patients with other types of donors)
      with a median onset at 8 months after transplantation. The 2-year cumulative
      incidence of EcD was 20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 11.2% to 31.5%) after CBT
      and 1.7% (95% CI, .90% to 2.90%) with other types of donors (P < .0001). Fifteen 
      cases had a skin biopsy without distinctive pathologic features of GVHD. The most
      common EcD-involved sites in CBT recipients were face (75%), neck (50%), and
      antecubital fossae (50%). Compared with patients with other types of donors, EcD 
      after CBT was more likely to involve three or more sites (10 of 12 vs. 2 of 10; P
      = .008) and had a more protracted course (lasting >6 months in 6 of 58 vs. 1 of
      661; P < .0001). In both groups, EcD responded to topical therapy, and only a few
      cases required systemic therapy. EcD is a relatively frequent skin condition
      among recipients of unrelated CBT. Irrespective of donor type, most cases of EcD 
      can be successfully managed with only topical therapy. These findings will help
      providers recognize EcD, avoid potentially harmful systemic therapy, and better
      counsel transplant recipients.

TI  - Efficient, Revocable and Privacy-preserving Fine-grained Data Sharing with
      Keyword Search for the Cloud-assisted Medical IoT System.
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2021.3100871 [doi]
AB  - The cloud-assisted medical Internet of Things (MIoT) has played a revolutionary
      role in promoting the quality of public medical services. However, the practical 
      deployment of cloud-assisted MIoT in an open healthcare scenario raises the
      concern on data security and user's privacy. Despite endeavors by academic and
      industrial community to eliminate this concern by cryptographic methods,
      resource-constrained devices in MIoT may be subject to the heavy computational
      overheads of cryptographic computations. To address this issue, this paper
      proposes an efficient, revocable, privacy-preserving fine-grained data sharing
      with keyword search (ERPF-DS-KS) scheme, which realizes the efficient and
      fine-grained access control and ciphertext keyword search, and enables the
      flexible indirect revocation to malicious data users. A pseudo identity-based
      signature mechanism is designed to provide the data authenticity. We analyze the 
      security properties of our proposed scheme, and via the theoretical comparison
      and experimental results we demonstrate that for the resource-constrained devices
      in the patient and doctor side of MIoT, in comparison with other related schemes,
      ERPF-DS-KS just consumes the lightweight and constant size communication/storage 
      as well as computational time cost. For the keyword search, compared with related
      schemes, the cloud can quickly check whether a ciphertext contains the specified 
      keyword with slight computations in the online phase. This further demonstrates
      that ERPF-DS-KS is efficient and practical in the cloud-assisted MIoT scenario.

TI  - The Role of 3D Exoscope Systems in Neurosurgery: An Optical Innovation.
PG  - e15878
LID - 10.7759/cureus.15878 [doi]
AB  - The development of the three-dimensional (3D) exoscope is a marvel of
      technological innovation in modern surgical practice. While its predecessor, the 
      operating microscope (OM), has long been the gold-standard surgical visualization
      modality, its particular limitations in terms of accessibility and ergonomic
      demand have led to the development of a more sophisticated, 3D model.
      Specifically, the 3D exoscope allows for an enhanced image quality of the
      surgical field, while also being more ergonomically favorable. Moreover, this
      device's ability to handle delicate microsensitve procedures, along with its
      alleviation of surgeon fatigue, indicates great potential for neurosurgical
      application. For this narrative review, the authors queried PubMed database using
      the keyword "exoscope" to identify relevant studies involving the specialty of
      neurosurgery that were published in English language full text. The search
      yielded full-text English language-related articles regarding neurosurgical
      exoscope, its applications and limitations. The 3D exoscope uniquely allows for
      enhanced surgeon comfort and superior imaging of the patient's real-time anatomy.
      However, the OM was described to having a slight image favorability with fusion
      and decompression surgery. Cost analysis is highlighted for its potential
      disparity. 3D exoscopes will potentially be incorporated with intelligent
      carriers and robotic surgical systems. Ultimately, with further studies
      highlighting its use, the 3D exoscope is expected to continue to imprint its
      status as one of the most efficient technological visualization tools in the
      future of neurosurgical practice.

AB  - It is more pressing than ever to reduce the time and costs for the development of
      lead compounds in the pharmaceutical industry. The co-occurrence of advances in
      high-throughput screening and the rise of deep learning (DL) have enabled the
      development of large-scale multimodal predictive models for virtual drug
      screening. Recently, deep generative models have emerged as a powerful tool to
      explore the chemical space and raise hopes to expedite the drug discovery
      process. Following this progress in chemocentric approaches for generative
      chemistry, the next challenge is to build multimodal conditional generative
      models that leverage disparate knowledge sources when mapping biochemical
      properties to target structures. Here, we call the community to bridge drug
      discovery more closely with systems biology when designing deep generative
      models. Complementing the plethora of reviews on the role of DL in
      chemoinformatics, we specifically focus on the interface of predictive and
      generative modelling for drug discovery. Through a systematic publication keyword
      search on PubMed and a selection of preprint servers (arXiv, biorXiv, chemRxiv,
      and medRxiv), we quantify trends in the field and find that molecular graphs and 
      VAEs have become the most widely adopted molecular representations and
      architectures in generative models, respectively. We discuss progress on DL for
      toxicity, drug-target affinity, and drug sensitivity prediction and specifically 
      focus on conditional molecular generative models that encompass multimodal
      prediction models. Moreover, we outline future prospects in the field and
      identify challenges such as the integration of deep learning systems into
      experimental workflows in a closed-loop manner or the adoption of federated
      machine learning techniques to overcome data sharing barriers. Other challenges
      include, but are not limited to interpretability in generative models, more
      sophisticated metrics for the evaluation of molecular generative models, and,
      following up on that, community-accepted benchmarks for both multimodal drug
      property prediction and property-driven molecular design.

      retrospective cross-sectional study.
LID - 10.1007/s11739-021-02818-5 [doi]
AB  - During periods such as the COVID-19 crisis, there is a need for responsive public
      health surveillance indicators related to the epidemic. To determine the
      performance of keyword-search algorithm in call reports to emergency medical
      communication centers (EMCC) to describe trends in symptoms during the COVID-19
      crisis. We retrospectively retrieved all free text call reports from the EMCC of 
      the Gironde department (SAMU 33), France, between 2005 and 2020 and classified
      them with a simple keyword-based algorithm to identify symptoms relevant to
      COVID-19. A validation was performed using a sample of manually coded call
      reports. The six selected symptoms were fever, cough, muscle soreness, dyspnea,
      ageusia and anosmia. We retrieved 38,08,243 call reports from January 2005 to
      October 2020. A total of 8539 reports were manually coded for validation and
      Cohen's kappa statistics ranged from 75 (keyword anosmia) to 59% (keyword
      dyspnea). There was an unprecedented peak in the number of daily calls mentioning
      fever, cough, muscle soreness, anosmia, ageusia, and dyspnea during the COVID-19 
      epidemic, compared to the past 15 years. Calls mentioning cough, fever and muscle
      soreness began to increase from February 21, 2020. The number of daily calls
      reporting cough reached 208 on March 3, 2020, a level higher than any in the
      previous 15 years, and peaked on March 15, 2020, 2 days before lockdown. Calls
      referring to dyspnea, anosmia and ageusia peaked 12 days later and were
      concomitant with the daily number of emergency room admissions. Trends in
      symptoms cited in calls to EMCC during the COVID-19 crisis provide insights into 
      the natural history of COVID-19. The content of calls to EMCC is an efficient
      epidemiological surveillance data source and should be integrated into the
      national surveillance system.

TI  - FVS 2.0: A unifying framework for understanding the factors of visual-attentional
      processing.
LID - 10.1037/rev0000314 [doi]
AB  - Across a broad range of stimulus types and tasks (16 stimulus types x 26 tasks,
      1,744 observers in total), the present study employed an individual-item
      differences analysis to extract the factors of visual-attentional processing.
      Three orthogonal factors were identified and they can be summarized as an FVS 2.0
      framework: featural, visual, and spatial strengths. Apart from one exception
      (low-level motion), the FVS 2.0 framework accounts for the vast majority (95.4%) 
      of the variances in the 25 tasks. Therefore, the three straightforward factors
      provide a unifying framework for understanding the relationship between stimulus 
      types as well as those between tasks. Combining these and other related results, 
      the role of preattentive features seems to be rather different from the
      traditional view: visual features are general purpose, exclusive, innate,
      constancy based, and keyword like. A general-purpose, exclusive, innate,
      constancy-based and keyword-like (GEICK) conjecture is proposed which suggests
      that the features are conscious-level keywords generated by the specific brain
      area of V4 and/or IT and then used by all other brain areas. (PsycInfo Database

PG  - e11850
LID - 10.7717/peerj.11850 [doi]
AB  - Complex interactions among multiple abiotic and biotic drivers result in rapid
      changes in ecosystems worldwide. Predicting how specific interactions can cause
      ripple effects potentially resulting in abrupt shifts in ecosystems is of high
      relevance to policymakers, but difficult to quantify using data from singular
      cases. We present causalizeR (https://github.com/fjmurguzur/causalizeR), a
      text-processing algorithm that extracts causal relations from literature based on
      simple grammatical rules that can be used to synthesize evidence in unstructured 
      texts in a structured manner. The algorithm extracts causal links using the
      relative position of nouns relative to the keyword of choice to extract the cause
      and effects of interest. The resulting database can be combined with network
      analysis tools to estimate the direct and indirect effects of multiple drivers at
      the network level, which is useful for synthesizing available knowledge and for
      hypothesis creation and testing. We illustrate the use of the algorithm by
      detecting causal relationships in scientific literature relating to the tundra
      ecosystem.

      and reproductive health in low-income and middle-income countries.
LID - e006033 [pii]
LID - 10.1136/bmjgh-2021-006033 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This paper is a scoping review of the impact of legal accountability 
      efforts for sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR), exploring the links
      between legal accountability strategies and changes in the desired SRHR outcomes.
      METHODS: We defined legal accountability as use of the judicial system following 
      state failure to respect, protect or fulfil SRHR as enshrined in national law, as
      well as individuals' or the state's use of criminal law mechanisms to prevent
      unwanted behaviour and to provide remedy. We undertook a keyword search in
      PubMed, Scopus and LexisNexis and then consulted a group of experts to provide
      guidance regarding further peer-reviewed and grey literature, yielding a total of
      191 articles. RESULTS: The majority of the empirical, peer-reviewed articles
      identified were regarding abortion law and abortion care availability, followed
      by violence against women. Most of these articles explore the gaps between law
      and practice. We identified seven key factors that shape the efficacy of legal
      accountability efforts, including the ways a law or court decision is formulated,
      access to courts, the (dis)advantages of criminal law in the given context,
      cultural norms, politics, state capacity and resources and the potential for
      further litigation. Many articles explained that use of the judiciary may be
      necessary to effect change and that the act of claiming rights can empower, but
      that legal avenues for change can be imperfect tools for justice. CONCLUSIONS:
      Legal accountability can be effective as part of a broader, long-term strategy,
      with due attention to context.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0255127 [doi]
AB  - Keyword extraction refers to the process of detecting the most relevant terms and
      expressions in a given text in a timely manner. In the information explosion era,
      keyword extraction has attracted increasing attention. The importance of keyword 
      extraction in text summarization, text comparisons, and document categorization
      has led to an emphasis on graph-based keyword extraction techniques because they 
      can capture more structural information compared to other classic text analysis
      methods. In this paper, we propose a simple unsupervised text mining approach
      that aims to extract a set of keywords from a given text and analyze its topic
      diversity using graph analysis tools. Initially, the text is represented as a
      directed graph using synonym relationships. Then, community detection and other
      measures are used to identify keywords in the text. The set of extracted keywords
      is used to assess topic diversity within the text and analyze its sentiment. The 
      proposed approach relies on grouping semantically similar candidate words. This
      approach ensures that the set of extracted keywords is comprehensive. Differing
      from other graph-based keyword extraction approaches, the proposed method does
      not require user parameters during graph construction and word scoring. The
      proposed approach achieved significant results compared to other keyword
      extraction techniques.

TI  - Endophthalmitis: a bibliographic review.
PG  - 4151-4161
LID - 10.1007/s10792-021-01967-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To analyze the 100 most cited articles pertaining to endophthalmitis
      using bibliometric analysis. METHODS: An all-time Web of Science literature
      search and refined to peer-reviewed articles in the field of ophthalmology with
      the keyword "endophthalmitis" was completed. Total citation count of articles
      published pertaining to endophthalmitis, topic, incidence rate, publishing
      journals, year published, language, country of origin, number of authors, names
      of the first and last authors, study type, and number of patients/eyes studied.
      RESULTS: The top 100 most cited articles pertaining to endophthalmitis had a mean
      citation count of 362.92, with a range of 175 to 3583. They were published in 20 
      peer-reviewed journals, with Ophthalmology publishing the most (n = 42). Thirteen
      different countries were represented, with the majority (n = 77) originating from
      the USA. The most common study type was clinical experiences (n = 52), though
      eight of the top ten were clinical trials. The number of patients varied widely, 
      represented by a mean of 9680, but with a median of only 229. The majority (n =
      67) examined the incidence of endophthalmitis which included 24 articles after
      anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injections, 18 after ocular
      surgeries/procedures, 15 after intraocular steroid injections, eight after
      chemotoxic drug use, and three after ocular injuries. CONCLUSION: This
      bibliographic study serves as a unique historical analysis of the top 100 cited
      scholarly articles pertaining to endophthalmitis with many of the articles
      related to post-procedural endophthalmitis.

TI  - Using Text Mining Techniques to Identify Health Care Providers With Patient
      Safety Problems: Exploratory Study.
PG  - e19064
LID - 10.2196/19064 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Regulatory bodies such as health care inspectorates can identify
      potential patient safety problems in health care providers by analyzing patient
      complaints. However, it is challenging to analyze the large number of complaints.
      Text mining techniques may help identify signals of problems with patient safety 
      at health care providers. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore whether
      employing text mining techniques on patient complaint databases can help identify
      potential problems with patient safety at health care providers and automatically
      predict the severity of patient complaints. METHODS: We performed an exploratory 
      study on the complaints database of the Dutch Health and Youth Care Inspectorate 
      with more than 22,000 written complaints. Severe complaints are defined as those 
      cases where the inspectorate contact point experts deemed it worthy of a triage
      by the inspectorate, or complaints that led to direct action by the inspectorate.
      We investigated a range of supervised machine learning techniques to assign a
      severity label to complaints that can be used to prioritize which incoming
      complaints need the most attention. We studied several features based on the
      complaints' written content, including sentiment analysis, to decide which were
      helpful for severity prediction. Finally, we showcased how we could combine these
      severity predictions and automatic keyword analysis on the complaints database
      and listed health care providers and their organization-specific complaints to
      determine the average severity of complaints per organization. RESULTS: A
      straightforward text classification approach using a bag-of-words feature
      representation worked best for the severity prediction of complaints. We obtained
      an accuracy of 87%-93% (2658-2990 of 3319 complaints) on the held-out test set
      and an F1 score of 45%-51% on the severe complaints. The skewed class
      distribution led to only reasonable recall (47%-54%) and precision (44%-49%)
      scores. The use of sentiment analysis for severity prediction was not helpful. By
      combining the predicted severity outcomes with an automatic keyword analysis, we 
      identified several health care providers that could have patient safety problems.
      CONCLUSIONS: Text mining techniques for analyzing complaints by civilians can
      support inspectorates. They can automatically predict the severity of the
      complaints, or they can be used for keyword analysis. This can help the
      inspectorate detect potential patient safety problems, or support prioritizing
      follow-up supervision activities by sorting complaints based on the severity per 
      organization or per sector.

TI  - Implications of Twitter in Health-Related Research: A Landscape Analysis of the
      Scientific Literature.
PG  - 654481
LID - 10.3389/fpubh.2021.654481 [doi]
AB  - Background: Twitter, representing a big social media network, is broadly used for
      the communication of health-related information. In this work, we aimed to
      identify and analyze the scientific literature on Twitter use in context of
      health by utilizing a bibliometric approach, in order to obtain quantitative
      information on dominant research topics, trending themes, key publications,
      scientific institutions, and prolific researchers who contributed to this
      scientific area. Methods: Web of Science electronic database was searched to
      identify relevant papers on Twitter and health. Basic bibliographic data was
      obtained utilizing the "Analyze" function of the database. Full records and cited
      references were exported to VOSviewer, a dedicated bibliometric software, for
      further analysis. A term map and a keyword map were synthesized to visualize
      recurring words within titles, abstracts and keywords. Results: The analysis was 
      based on the data from 2,582 papers. The first papers were published in 2009, and
      the publication count increased rapidly since 2015. Original articles and reviews
      were published in a ratio of 10.6:1. The Journal of Medical Internet Research was
      the top journal, and the United States had contributions to over half (52%) of
      these publications, being the home-country of eight of the top ten most
      productive institutions. Keyword analysis identified six topically defined
      clusters, with professional education in healthcare being the top theme cluster
      (consisting of 66 keywords). The identified papers often investigated Twitter
      together with other social media, such as YouTube and Facebook. Conclusions: A
      great diversity of themes was found in the identified papers, including:
      professional education in healthcare, big data and sentiment analysis, social
      marketing and substance use, physical and emotional well-being of young adults,
      and public health and health communication. Our quantitative analysis outlines
      Twitter as both, an increasingly popular data source, and a highly versatile tool
      for health-related research.

      Analysis of Publications Indexed in Web of Science.
PG  - 2099-2116
LID - 10.1007/s12671-021-01681-x [doi]
AB  - Objectives: This study aimed to identify historical developments, active research
      areas, and emerging trends within scientific literature on mindfulness published 
      so far, using bibliometric methods. We also aimed to identify prominent journals,
      authors, organizations, and countries in the field of mindfulness. Methods:
      Articles or reviews which mention mindfulness in the title, abstract, or keywords
      were identified using the Web of Science. A descriptive summary of the literature
      was obtained from the Web of Science Analysis tool. Country collaboration,
      co-authorship, and keyword co-occurrence networks were visualized using
      VOSviewer. CiteSpace, which uses document co-citation analysis, was used to
      identify emerging trends and transient patterns in the literature. Results: From 
      1966 to 2021, 16,581 publications on mindfulness were identified. There has been 
      an exponential growth of publications since 2006. Almost half (47%) of the
      publications were in psychology and about one-fifth (20.8%) in psychiatry. The
      most prolific journal was Mindfulness (contributing 7% of all publications) and
      the most prolific author was Eric L. Garland. The vast majority of publications
      originated from Western countries but representation from Asian countries has
      increased. The most frequently co-occurring keywords were meditation, depression,
      stress, and anxiety. Co-citation analysis of the early period (1966-2015)
      revealed how scholarly work on spiritual themes has inspired early mindfulness
      research. Recent trends (2016-2021) revealed a rising interest in mechanisms and 
      moderators, long-term meditation, neuroscientific studies, and smartphone/online 
      delivery of interventions. Conclusions: This comprehensive bibliometric study
      summarized and visualized 55 years of mindfulness research, revealing pivotal
      points, active research areas, and emerging trends.

TI  - What do COVID-19 Tweets Reveal about Public Engagement with Nature of Science?
PG  - 1-31
LID - 10.1007/s11191-021-00233-y [doi]
AB  - Using the social media platform Twitter, this study explores public reference to 
      "scientific method(s)" in tweets specifically pertaining to COVID-19 posted
      between January and June 2020. The study focuses on three research questions:
      When did reference to scientific methods peak, which aspects of nature of science
      (NOS) do these tweets address, and the extent to which Twitter users' sentiments 
      provide useful information about their attitudes towards the scientific method.
      COVID-19 tweets were mined and queried using "scientific method(s)" as a keyword.
      A content analysis using the Family Resemblance Approach (FRA) to NOS and a
      non-computational sentiment analysis were conducted on the obtained data set. The
      findings revealed that tweets using science method(s) peaked most during the
      months of April and May, as more information was being communicated about
      promising treatments and vaccine development. Most tweets were assigned multiple 
      FRA categories. The sentiment analysis revealed that attitude towards the
      scientific method was predominantly supportive. Discussion of three events that
      were observed in clusters of tweets provided additional context. The paper
      concludes by noting the methodological affordances and limitations of applying
      the FRA for identifying NOS-related content in Twitter environments and
      underscoring the potential of targeted NOS messaging in promoting informed
      discussions about NOS in the public sphere.

TI  - Synthetic strategy toward ineleganolide: A cautionary tale.
LID - 132289 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.tet.2021.132289 [doi]
AB  - We present a case study to demonstrate how complex molecule synthesis can benefit
      from quantum mechanics (QM) calculations. Theory is applied in two contexts:
      testing the chemical intuition used in retrosynthetic planning, along with
      expediting the resolution of unexpected challenges encountered during the course 
      of the synthesis. From a computational lens, we examine retrospectively the
      strategies employed and the decisions made during our synthetic efforts toward
      the diterpenoid natural product ineleganolide. Seemingly logical and robust
      hypotheses are found to be ill-fated after theoretical investigation. Prior
      knowledge of these issues may have potentially saved valuable time and resources 
      during our synthetic efforts. This cautionary tale suggests that synthetic
      campaigns can benefit from computational evaluation of synthetic plans.

TI  - Contextualized Filtering for Shared Cyber Threat Information.
LID - 4890 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s21144890 [doi]
AB  - Cyber threat information sharing is an imperative process towards achieving
      collaborative security, but it poses several challenges. One crucial challenge is
      the plethora of shared threat information. Therefore, there is a need to advance 
      filtering of such information. While the state-of-the-art in filtering relies
      primarily on keyword- and domain-based searching, these approaches require
      sizable human involvement and rarely available domain expertise. Recent research 
      revealed the need for harvesting of business information to fill the gap in
      filtering, albeit it resulted in providing coarse-grained filtering based on the 
      utilization of such information. This paper presents a novel contextualized
      filtering approach that exploits standardized and multi-level contextual
      information of business processes. The contextual information describes the
      conditions under which a given threat information is actionable from an
      organization perspective. Therefore, it can automate filtering by measuring the
      equivalence between the context of the shared threat information and the context 
      of the consuming organization. The paper directly contributes to filtering
      challenge and indirectly to automated customized threat information sharing.
      Moreover, the paper proposes the architecture of a cyber threat information
      sharing ecosystem that operates according to the proposed filtering approach and 
      defines the characteristics that are advantageous to filtering approaches.
      Implementation of the proposed approach can support compliance with the Special
      Publication 800-150 of the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

TI  - Hough Transform-Based Angular Features for Learning-Free Handwritten Keyword
      Spotting.
LID - 4648 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s21144648 [doi]
AB  - Handwritten keyword spotting (KWS) is of great interest to the document image
      research community. In this work, we propose a learning-free keyword spotting
      method following query by example (QBE) setting for handwritten documents. It
      consists of four key processes: pre-processing, vertical zone division, feature
      extraction, and feature matching. The pre-processing step deals with the noise
      found in the word images, and the skewness of the handwritings caused by the
      varied writing styles of the individuals. Next, the vertical zone division splits
      the word image into several zones. The number of vertical zones is guided by the 
      number of letters in the query word image. To obtain this information (i.e.,
      number of letters in a query word image) during experimentation, we use the text 
      encoding of the query word image. The user provides the information to the
      system. The feature extraction process involves the use of the Hough transform.
      The last step is feature matching, which first compares the features extracted
      from the word images and then generates a similarity score. The performance of
      this algorithm has been tested on three publicly available datasets: IAM, QUWI,
      and ICDAR KWS 2015. It is noticed that the proposed method outperforms
      state-of-the-art learning-free KWS methods considered here for comparison while
      evaluated on the present datasets. We also evaluate the performance of the
      present KWS model using state-of-the-art deep features and it is found that the
      features used in the present work perform better than the deep features extracted
      using InceptionV3, VGG19, and DenseNet121 models.

TI  - Lean Healthcare Tools for Processes Evaluation: An Integrative Review.
LID - 7389 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18147389 [doi]
AB  - Several health services have used lean healthcare to seek continuous improvement 
      of their processes. Therefore, it is important to investigate the evidence
      available in the literature about the most used lean tools in the health area to 
      review processes and the main results achieved by the researchers. As an
      integrative literature review methodology was used, it was conducted in five
      databases, using the descriptor "quality improvement" and the keyword "Lean
      Healthcare". A total of 33 complete articles were selected for analysis. The most
      recurrent tools were: define, measure, analyze, improve and control (DMAIC);
      value stream map (VSM); suppliers, inputs, process, outputs, customers analysis
      (SIPOC), Ishikawa Diagram and 5S. Through the analysis of waste, different
      interventions were implemented and the main results achieved were reduction in
      times (processing, waiting, cycle and total), costs, workload and increase in the
      number of calls. The findings enabled the identification of the main lean tools
      used in the health area to achieve better results. In particular, we highlight
      recent studies that have explored the lean six sigma healthcare approach. The
      results, in addition to contributing to the literature, will also assist managers
      in choosing the best tool to achieve continuous improvement in hospitals and
      other health services.

TI  - Changes in the Structures and Directions of Heavy Metal-Contaminated Soil
      Remediation Research from 1999 to 2020: A Bibliometric & Scientometric Study.
LID - 7358 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18147358 [doi]
AB  - The pollution of heavy metals in soil is a problem of great concern to
      international scholars today. This research investigates the current research
      activities in the field of soil heavy metal pollution remediation and discusses
      the current areas of research focus and development trends. We conducted a
      bibliometric analysis of the literature on soil heavy metal pollution remediation
      from 1999 to 2020. CiteSpace and Vosviewer were used to conduct document
      co-citation and cluster analyses on the collected data. The research was mainly
      carried out based on the following factors: chronological distribution, country
      and institution distribution, source journal analysis, keyword co-occurrence
      analysis, and reference co-citation analysis. China (2173, 28.64%) and the United
      States (946, 12.47%) are the top two countries in terms of the number of articles
      published, and Environmental Science and Pollution Research (384, 5.06%) and
      Science of the Total Environment (345, 4.55%) published the most articles. The
      Chinese Academy of Science (485) is the organization that has contributed the
      most to the total number of publications. Furthermore, based on a keyword co-word
      analysis with Vosviewer and CitesSpace, it was concluded that the applications of
      phytoremediation and biochar in the remediation of heavy metals in soil are
      current research hotspots. Additionally, future research should focus on repair
      mechanisms, the development of new repair technology and joint repair systems.

AB  - Mining companies use environmental sustainability reporting to inform their
      stakeholders about their position in relation to environmental sustainability.
      This paper explores how these companies include topics related to the environment
      and its protection in their annual reports. The 100 largest mining companies
      listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) were included in the research
      sample, using market capitalisation as the size indicator. The investigation was 
      performed by means of quantitative and qualitative content analysis of annual
      reports to identify relevant keyword occurrences. Results revealed that topics
      related to protection of the environment, emissions, carbon footprint, and
      climate change are addressed in companies' annual reports. In line with research 
      in other industries, this study confirmed that the intensity of communication
      about these topics varies with company size. A new methodology was developed to
      assess the extent to which mining companies inform the stakeholders about their
      environmental protection initiatives and to address the limited applicability of 
      the GRI G3 disclosure checklist for sustainability reporting, thereby enhancing
      the theory of social licence to operate.

TI  - Validity and risk factor analysis for helicopter emergency medical services in
      Japan: a pilot study.
PG  - 87
LID - 10.1186/s12873-021-00471-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Some emergency departments use triage scales, such as the Canadian
      Triage and Acuity Scale and Japan Urgent Stroke Triage Score, to detect
      life-threatening situations. However, these protocols have not been used for
      aeromedical services. Therefore, we investigated the factors predicting these
      life-threatening situations in aeromedical services as a pilot study for
      establishing the protocol. METHOD: We retrospectively evaluated helicopter
      emergency medical service cases from 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2020 at Gifu
      University Hospital using the mission records. We only evaluated cases dealing
      with suggested internal medicine issues. We excluded cases influenced by external
      factors such as trauma or cases that included hospital-to-hospital
      transportation, focusing only on prehospital care. We evaluated the validity of
      the medical emergencies based on the needs for emergency interventions and
      hospital admission and of the suggested diagnoses and associated risk factors.
      RESULT: A total of 451 cases were suitable for inclusion in the study. In the
      analysis for all emergency calls, 235 (52.11%) cases needed emergency
      intervention and 300 (64.4%) required hospital admission. The suggested diagnosis
      was valid for 261 (57.87%) cases. After the first assessment by emergency medical
      technicians, 75 cases were removed. Analysis after this first assessment found
      that 52.31% cases required emergency intervention, 70.26% needed admission, and
      the suggested diagnosis was valid for 69.41% of cases. In the analysis of
      emergency calls, the multivariate analysis of some key variables identified age, 
      playing sports, and gasping as risk factors for emergency intervention. Hospital 
      admission risk factors included being age only. The suggested diagnosis was valid
      only for sports situations. In the analysis after the first assessment by an
      emergency medical technician, risk factors for emergency intervention included
      being age being male, playing sports, and gasping, and those for hospital
      admission was being age, being male, and experiencing stroke symptoms and/or
      disturbance of consciousness. The suggested diagnosis was valid only for sports
      situations. CONCLUSION: Some 'second' keywords/phrases predict medical
      emergencies. Therefore, the dispatch commander should gather these
      keyword/phrases to assess.

TI  - Google trends in "anatomy": pre-pandemic versus during COVID-19 pandemic.
PG  - 49-53
LID - 10.1007/s00276-021-02806-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of the present study was to assess the online search
      behavior for the keyword "anatomy" worldwide and to compare the pre-pandemic and 
      during COVID-19 pandemic scenario for the same. METHODS: Google trends tool was
      used for the assessment of the search behavior for the term "anatomy". The data, 
      i.e. relative search volume (RSV) were downloaded for this term using the all
      categories, web search and only YouTube settings during a period from 1.1.2019 to
      3.31.2021 from www.trends.google.com . The geographic trends for this search
      query were plotted across the world. RESULTS: Seasonal peaks were observed for
      the search term "anatomy" during the first 3 months of the year and in months of 
      September, October and November in 2019. Similar seasonal peaks were observed for
      the year 2020 except that there was sudden decrease in RSV for term "anatomy" in 
      the month of March. Though trend for the rest of the year was same, but there was
      general lower RSV in 2020. The country with highest search hit was United States 
      followed by Canada, Ireland, Australia and Philippines. CONCLUSION: The search
      trend for pre-pandemic and pandemic period was similar with overall lower RSV
      during 2020, where it noticeably decreased during the initial phase of lockdown, 
      i.e. in the month of March. As the whole world is still in the COVID-19 pandemic 
      era, the future studies may report the google trends once the pandemic is over
      and may compare the post-pandemic trend for the same.

TI  - Patient Peer-to-Peer Mentoring for Patients with Kidney Failure: Methods,
      Facilitators, and Lessons Learned.
PG  - 227-235
AB  - Prior research among patients with kidney failure has found peer mentoring to be 
      an effective strategy for improving patient outcomes. However, a gap remains in
      understanding how peer mentoring can be utilized to support a patient's
      decision-making in choosing a kidney replacement treatment modality. Quality
      Insights, Inc., has developed and implemented a patient advocacy program (PAP) to
      support patients in choosing home dialysis as a treatment option and pursuing
      kidney transplant through waitlisting. Mentors, known as patient advocates,
      follow a three-step process that includes peer-to-peer mentor training,
      developing a patient testimonial, and integration into the quality improvement
      team. The PAP has increased interest among in-center patients on hemodialysis
      considering home dialysis or kidney transplant. Additionally, barriers,
      facilitators, and lessons learned have been identified in supporting a patient
      peer-to-peer mentoring program.

TI  - Health informatics publication trends in Saudi Arabia: a bibliometric analysis
      over the last twenty-four years.
PG  - 219-239
LID - 10.5195/jmla.2021.1072 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Understanding health informatics (HI) publication trends in Saudi
      Arabia may serve as a framework for future research efforts and contribute toward
      meeting national "e-Health" goals. The authors' intention was to understand the
      state of the HI field in Saudi Arabia by exploring publication trends and their
      alignment with national goals. Methods: A scoping review was performed to
      identify HI publications from Saudi Arabia in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science.
      We analyzed publication trends based on topics, keywords, and how they align with
      the Ministry of Health's (MOH's) "digital health journey" framework. Results: The
      total number of publications included was 242. We found 1 (0.4%) publication in
      1995-1999, 11 (4.5%) publications in 2000-2009, and 230 (95.0%) publications in
      2010-2019. We categorized publications into 3 main HI fields and 4 subfields:
      73.1% (n=177) of publications were in clinical informatics (85.1%, n=151 medical 
      informatics; 5.6%, n=10 pharmacy informatics; 6.8%, n=12 nursing informatics;
      2.3%, n=4 dental informatics); 22.3% (n=54) were in consumer health informatics; 
      and 4.5% (n=11) were in public health informatics. The most common keyword was
      "medical informatics" (21.5%, n=52). MOH framework-based analysis showed that
      most publications were categorized as "digitally enabled care" and "digital
      health foundations." Conclusions: The years of 2000-2009 may be seen as an
      infancy stage of the HI field in Saudi Arabia. Exploring how the Saudi Arabian
      MOH's e-Health initiatives may influence research is valuable for advancing the
      field. Data exchange and interoperability, artificial intelligence, and
      intelligent health enterprises might be future research directions in Saudi
      Arabia.

AB  - Rigorous measures are required to cope with the advance of extracellular vesicle 
      (EV) research, from 183 studies published in 2012 to 2,309 studies published in
      2020. The International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) proposed
      Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles (MISEV) guidelines in
      2014, updated in 2018, for assuring and improving EV research quality. We
      performed a systematic review using a text mining approach to assess adherence to
      MISEV criteria. A keyword search was conducted in 5,093 accessible publications
      over the period 2012-2020 and analyzed the methodology used for EV isolation and 
      characterization. We found a significant improvement over the years particularly 
      regarding EV characterization where recent papers used a higher number of methods
      and EV markers to check for quantity and purity. Interestingly, we also found
      that EV papers using more methods and EV markers were cited more frequently.
      Papers citing MISEV criteria were more prone to use a higher number of
      characterization methods. We therefore established a concise checklist
      summarizing MISEV criteria to support EV researchers towards reaching the highest
      standards in the field.

AB  - This article analyzes research outputs in ergonomics and human factors
      engineering (EHFE), revealing its intellectual structure via bibliometric
      techniques, co-word analysis, network analysis and science visualization tools.
      The population comprises 23,472 records published during 2000-2018 in 19 core
      journals of the human factors and ergonomics subject category in Scopus. Findings
      showed that in EHFE fields 'the United States', 'University of Central Florida'
      and 'Stanton NA' were the most productive country, university and author,
      respectively. It was also found that 'ergonomics' was the most frequent keyword
      and 'ergonomics x human factor' the most frequent co-occurring keywords in EHFE
      documents. Hierarchical cluster analysis led to creation of eight topical
      clusters, including among others 'biomechanics ergonomics', 'work-related
      musculoskeletal disorders & work system design' and 'performance'. The results
      indicated that 'biomechanics ergonomics' was a well-matured cluster while 'human 
      machine interaction', 'ergonomics design', 'macro-ergonomics' and 'cognitive
      ergonomics' were found to be emerging or declining clusters.

TI  - The effectiveness of autologous demineralized tooth graft for the bone ridge
      preservation: a systematic review of the literature.
PG  - 283-294
LID - 10.23812/21-2supp1-28 [doi]
AB  - Resorption of alveolar ridge after tooth extraction often compromises dental
      implant placement and esthetic. Alveolar ridge preservation is a common procedure
      performed in order to preserve the pontic site for a prosthetically ideal
      position. This procedure has already become an indisputable need. Tooth matrix as
      bone substituted material poses osteoconduction and osteoinduction properties and
      as autologous graft, this material is free of antigenic reaction. This
      biomaterial allows the threedimensional reconstruction of the bone, is easy to
      prepare and has a low cost. The aim of this review is to summarize and put in
      evidence the properties of tooth as bone substitute and its use in alveolar ridge
      preservation. Keyword: autologous tooth, autologous graft, bone regeneration,
      bone substitute, alveolar ridge preservation, alveolar ridge augmentation, socket
      preservation.

TI  - Association Between What People Learned About COVID-19 Using Web Searches and
      Their Behavior Toward Public Health Guidelines: Empirical Infodemiology Study.
PG  - e28975
LID - 10.2196/28975 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of the internet and web-based platforms to obtain public
      health information and manage health-related issues has become widespread in this
      digital age. The practice is so pervasive that the first reaction to obtaining
      health information is to "Google it." As SARS-CoV-2 broke out in Wuhan, China, in
      December 2019 and quickly spread worldwide, people flocked to the internet to
      learn about the novel coronavirus and the disease, COVID-19. Lagging responses by
      governments and public health agencies to prioritize the dissemination of
      information about the coronavirus outbreak through the internet and the World
      Wide Web and to build trust gave room for others to quickly populate social
      media, online blogs, news outlets, and websites with misinformation and
      conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in people's deviant
      behaviors toward public health safety measures. OBJECTIVE: The goals of this
      study were to determine what people learned about the COVID-19 pandemic through
      web searches, examine any association between what people learned about COVID-19 
      and behavior toward public health guidelines, and analyze the impact of
      misinformation and conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 pandemic on people's
      behavior toward public health measures. METHODS: This infodemiology study used
      Google Trends' worldwide search index, covering the first 6 months after the
      SARS-CoV-2 outbreak (January 1 to June 30, 2020) when the public scrambled for
      information about the pandemic. Data analysis employed statistical trends,
      correlation and regression, principal component analysis (PCA), and predictive
      models. RESULTS: The PCA identified two latent variables comprising past
      coronavirus epidemics (pastCoVepidemics: keywords that address previous
      epidemics) and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (presCoVpandemic: keywords that
      explain the ongoing pandemic). Both principal components were used significantly 
      to learn about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 and explained 88.78% of the variability.
      Three principal components fuelled misinformation about COVID-19: misinformation 
      (keywords "biological weapon," "virus hoax," "common cold," "COVID-19 hoax," and 
      "China virus"), conspiracy theory 1 (ConspTheory1; keyword "5G" or "@5G"), and
      conspiracy theory 2 (ConspTheory2; keyword "ingest bleach"). These principal
      components explained 84.85% of the variability. The principal components
      represent two measurements of public health safety guidelines-public health
      measures 1 (PubHealthMes1; keywords "social distancing," "wash hands,"
      "isolation," and "quarantine") and public health measures 2 (PubHealthMes2;
      keyword "wear mask")-which explained 84.7% of the variability. Based on the PCA
      results and the log-linear and predictive models, ConspTheory1 (keyword "@5G")
      was identified as a predictor of people's behavior toward public health measures 
      (PubHealthMes2). Although correlations of misinformation (keywords "COVID-19,"
      "hoax," "virus hoax," "common cold," and more) and ConspTheory2 (keyword "ingest 
      bleach") with PubHealthMes1 (keywords "social distancing," "hand wash,"
      "isolation," and more) were r=0.83 and r=-0.11, respectively, neither was
      statistically significant (P=.27 and P=.13, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Several
      studies focused on the impacts of social media and related platforms on the
      spreading of misinformation and conspiracy theories. This study provides the
      first empirical evidence to the mainly anecdotal discourse on the use of web
      searches to learn about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.

LID - 10.17116/patol20218304169 [doi]
AB  - Gastric cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer morbidity and mortality
      worldwide. It is common practice to use two classification systems: the Lauren
      classification system and the WHO classification of tumors in the morphological
      study of gastric carcinomas. Since 2010, the WHO classifications have included
      the term "poorly cohesive carcinoma", which refers to all diffuse forms of
      gastric cancer, including signet ring cell carcinoma and other subtypes. Despite 
      this, the term has not been widely used in the world community, and it is almost 
      not found in Russian literature. Only recently, after the publication of the 5th 
      edition of the WHO classification (2019), there have been review articles where
      the term is used, but its name can be translated into Russian in different ways: 
      poor-, weak -, low-adhesive, discogesive. The paper analyzes the Pubmed and
      Elibrary databases in order to find out the frequency of using various
      designations for diffuse gastric carcinoma, justifies the use of the term
      <<poorly cohesive carcinoma>>, and proposes a variant of the term interpretation 
      in Russian.

TI  - Racial and socioeconomic disparities in the use of stereotactic body radiotherapy
      for treating non-small cell lung cancer: a narrative review.
PG  - 3764-3771
LID - 10.21037/jtd-20-3199 [doi]
AB  - In the past two decades, there has been a steady increase in the use of
      stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) as an alternative to surgical intervention 
      for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients; however, not much is
      known about the impact of race and socioeconomic status (SES) on the delivery of 
      SBRT. Here, we conduct a narrative review to examine potential disparities in the
      use of SBRT. Keyword searches of MEDLINE/PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and
      Google Scholar databases were performed for studies focused on race, SES, and the
      use of SBRT published between 2000 and 2020. Six studies were identified, and
      showed that minority patients, especially Blacks, were less likely to receive
      SBRT and had a significantly longer median time between diagnosis to SBRT
      treatment. Patients with lower income or lower education, as well as those from
      lower socioeconomic regions were less likely to receive SBRT; they were more
      likely to receive conventionally fractionated external beam radiation (CFRT) or
      no treatment. These racial and socioeconomic factors were associated with worse
      survival in other general early-stage NSCLC studies. In conclusion, the limited
      number of published studies suggest significant disparities in the treatment of
      early-stage NSCLC with SBRT. These factors potentially lead to worse survival
      outcomes among vulnerable patient populations. Equal access to SBRT should be a
      focus of healthcare delivery systems, to ensure optimal clinical outcomes for
      patients with early-stage NSCLC.

      Room.

AB  - In insanity cases, although the defendant's eventual punishment is legally
      irrelevant to the jury's decision, it may be psychologically relevant. In this
      three-part mixed-methods study, Canadian jury eligible participants (N = 83) read
      a fictional murder case involving an insanity claim, then took part in 45-min
      deliberations. Findings showed that mock jurors who were generally favourable
      towards punishment had a lower frequency of utterances that supported the
      Defence's case. A qualitative description of keyword flagged utterances also
      demonstrated that mock jurors relied on moral intuitions about authority, harm,
      and fairness in justifying their positions. These findings may have application
      in crafting effective Judge's instructions and lawyer's opening statements.

TI  - COVID-19 pandemic in the Middle East countries: coronavirus-seeking behavior
      versus coronavirus-related publications.
PG  - 1-21
LID - 10.1007/s11192-021-04066-y [doi]
AB  - The spread of COVID-19 has created a fundamental need for coordinated mechanisms 
      responding to outbreaks in different sectors. One of the main sectors relates to 
      information supply and demand in the middle of this pandemic in the digital
      environment. It could be called an infodemiology. It is known as a promising
      approach to solving the challenge in the present age. At this level, the purpose 
      of this article is to investigate the COVID-19 related search process by field
      research. Data were retrieved from Google Trends in Middle Eastern countries
      alongside scientific research output of Middle Eastern scientists towards
      COVID-19 in Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed. Daily COVID-19 cases and deaths
      were retrieved from the World Health Organization. We searched for descriptive
      statistical analyses to detect coronavirus-seeking behavior versus coronavirus
      releases in the Middle East in 2020. Findings show that people in the Middle East
      use various keyword solutions to search for COVID-19 in Google. There is a
      significant correlation between coronavirus confirmed cases and scientific
      productivity (January 2020-December 2020). Also, there is a positive association 
      between the number of deaths and the number of scientific publications (except
      Jordan). It was a positive and significant association between online
      coronavirus-seeking behavior on Google (RSVs) and the confirmed cases (except
      Syria and Yemen). Furthermore, it was a positive relationship between RSVs and
      scientific productivity in the Middle East (except Bahrain and Qatar). From an
      infodemiological viewpoint, there is a significant correlation between
      coronavirus information demand and its information provision.

TI  - Global research publications on systemic use of off-label and unlicensed drugs: A
      bibliometric analysis (1990-2020).
LID - 10.3233/JRS-210012 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Governmental regulations of drug registration and licensing are not
      always followed by healthcare providers. OBJECTIVE: To explore the global
      research growth and patterns on systemic use of off-label and unlicensed drugs to
      gain knowledge about the magnitude of the problem and the main research themes
      encountered in this field. METHODS: SciVerse Scopus was searched for papers on
      off-label and unlicensed drug use from 1990 until December 31, 2020, without any 
      language limitations. A bibliometric methodology was adopted to present the
      following indicators: top-cited documents, the most productive countries, top
      active journals, international research collaboration, the most frequent author
      keywords, and research themes. RESULTS: The search query returned 1320 papers
      with an h-index of 66, published in 721 different journals. The Hospital Pharmacy
      journal ranked first (n = 43, 3.3%). In total, 5777 authors (median = 3) from 85 
      different countries contributed to the retrieved papers. The USA (n = 381, 28.9%)
      ranked first, followed distantly by Germany and Italy. The percentage of
      documents with international authors for active countries was from 8.8% for China
      to 42.3% for the Netherlands. The most frequent author keyword next to off-label 
      was children/pediatrics. The keyword unlicensed was less frequently encountered
      than that for off-label. Major research themes in the retrieved papers focused on
      off-label drug use in hospitalized children/pediatrics, biological drugs such as 
      rituximab and rFVIIa, psychiatric disorders, regulations, and questionnaire-based
      knowledge/attitude studies among community pharmacists and physicians.
      CONCLUSIONS: Research activity on off-label drug use has witnessed a general
      increase in the past two decades. The major research theme was off-label drug use
      in hospitalized children/pediatrics/neonates. The USA and certain European
      countries made a major contribution to this field.

TI  - Need of care in interpreting Google Trends-based COVID-19 infodemiological study 
      results: potential risk of false-positivity.
PG  - 147
LID - 10.1186/s12874-021-01338-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Google Trends (GT) is being used as an epidemiological tool to study 
      coronavirus disease (COVID-19) by identifying keywords in search trends that are 
      predictive for the COVID-19 epidemiological burden. However, many of the earlier 
      GT-based studies include potential statistical fallacies by measuring the
      correlation between non-stationary time sequences without adjusting for multiple 
      comparisons or the confounding of media coverage, leading to concerns about the
      increased risk of obtaining false-positive results. In this study, we aimed to
      apply statistically more favorable methods to validate the earlier GT-based
      COVID-19 study results. METHODS: We extracted the relative GT search volume for
      keywords associated with COVID-19 symptoms, and evaluated their Granger-causality
      to weekly COVID-19 positivity in eight English-speaking countries and Japan. In
      addition, the impact of media coverage on keywords with significant
      Granger-causality was further evaluated using Japanese regional data. RESULTS:
      Our Granger causality-based approach largely decreased (by up to approximately
      one-third) the number of keywords identified as having a significant temporal
      relationship with the COVID-19 trend when compared to those identified by Pearson
      or Spearman's rank correlation-based approach. "Sense of smell" and "loss of
      smell" were the most reliable GT keywords across all the evaluated countries;
      however, when adjusted with their media coverage, these keyword trends did not
      Granger-cause the COVID-19 positivity trends (in Japan). CONCLUSIONS: Our results
      suggest that some of the search keywords reported as candidate predictive
      measures in earlier GT-based COVID-19 studies may potentially be unreliable;
      therefore, caution is necessary when interpreting published GT-based study
      results.

TI  - One hundred years of zoonoses research in the Horn of Africa: A scoping review.
PG  - e0009607
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0009607 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: One Health is particularly relevant to the Horn of Africa where many 
      people's livelihoods are highly dependent on livestock and their shared
      environment. In this context, zoonoses may have a dramatic impact on both human
      and animal health, but also on country economies. This scoping review aimed to
      characterise and evaluate the nature of zoonotic disease research in the Horn
      region. Specifically, it addressed the following questions: (i) what specific
      zoonotic diseases have been prioritised for research, (ii) what data have been
      reported (human, animal or environment), (iii) what methods have been applied,
      and (iv) who has been doing the research? METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used
      keyword combinations to search online databases for peer-reviewed papers and
      theses. Screening and data extraction (disease, country, domain and method) was
      performed using DistillerSR. A total of 2055 studies focusing on seven countries 
      and over 60 zoonoses were included. Brucellosis attracted the highest attention
      in terms of research while anthrax, Q fever and leptospirosis have been
      comparatively under-studied. Research efforts did not always align with zoonoses 
      priorities identified at national levels. Despite zoonoses being a clear target
      for 'One Health' research, a very limited proportion of studies report data on
      the three domains of human, animal and environment. Descriptive and observational
      epidemiological studies were dominant and only a low proportion of publications
      were multidisciplinary. Finally, we found that a minority of international
      collaborations were between Global South countries with a high proportion of
      authors having affiliations from outside the Horn of Africa.
      CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: There is a growing interest in zoonoses research in the
      Horn of Africa. Recommendations arising from this scoping review include: (i)
      ensuring zoonoses research aligns with national and global research agendas; (ii)
      encouraging researchers to adopt a holistic, transdisciplinary One Health
      approach following high quality reporting standards (COHERE, PRISMA, etc.); and
      (iii) empowering local researchers supported by regional and international
      partnerships to engage in zoonoses research.

TI  - Information on the Internet about clear aligner treatment-an assessment of
      content, quality, and readability.
LID - 10.1007/s00056-021-00331-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The goal was to evaluate the content, quality, and readability of the
      information available about clear aligner treatment on the Internet. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: The search terms "aligner," "clear aligner," and "Invisalign" (Align
      Technology, Tempe, AZ, USA) were analyzed in three search engines (Google [Google
      LLC, Mountain View, CA, USA], Bing [Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA], and Yahoo
      [Yahoo, Sunnyvale, CA, USA]). The first 50 websites for each keyword in each
      search engine were screened. Duplicate websites, advertisements, links to
      scientific articles, videos, and other irrelevant websites were excluded. The
      quality of the remaining websites was analyzed using the DISCERN and Journal of
      American Medical Association (JAMA) benchmark instruments together with the
      Health on the Net code (HONcode, Health On the Net Foundation, Geneva,
      Switzerland). The readability of the websites was evaluated by the Flesch Reading
      Ease Score (FRES) and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL). Statistical analyses
      were performed by one-way analysis of variance, Kruskal-Wallis and Fischer's
      exact tests, with p< 0.05 accepted to be statistically significant. RESULTS:
      Among 111 evaluated websites, most belonged to multidisciplinary dental clinics
      (n= 49; 44.2%), followed by aligner companies (n= 26; 23.4%), orthodontists (n=
      26; 23.4%), and professional organizations (n= 10; 9%). The mean DISCERN score
      (sections 1 and 2) for all websites was 29.95/75. The average FRES and FKGL were 
      55.77 and 9.74, respectively. Professional organization websites had
      significantly higher DISCERN scores than others (p< 0.001), and together with
      multidisciplinary dental clinic websites, they showed better compliance with JAMA
      benchmark criteria. Professional organization websites' FRES and FKGL were also
      higher than other websites (p> 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the quality of
      web-based information about clear aligners was poor and the readability of the
      data was insufficient. Websites presenting high-quality data with better
      readability are needed for potential aligner patients.

TI  - EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors alone or in combination with chemotherapy for
      non-small-cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations: A meta-analysis of randomized
      controlled trials.
PG  - 664-670
LID - 10.4103/jcrt.JCRT_195_20 [doi]
AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to perform a meta-analysis comparing
      the efficiency of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase
      inhibitors (TKIs) with chemotherapy to EGFR TKI treatment alone in patients with 
      EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Materials and Methods:
      Following keyword queries in databases and identification of randomized control
      trials for inclusion, hazard ratios (HRs), relative risks (RRs), and associated
      95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were determined. Results: Ten randomized
      controlled trials involving 1354 participants with NSCLC were evaluated. We found
      that a combined approach of chemotherapy with EGFR TKIs significantly improved
      overall survival (OS) compared with EGFR TKI alone in our patient cohort (HR =
      0.47, 95% CI = 0.31-0.72). In addition, a higher overall response rate (ORR) was 
      found for patients who received combined treatment compared to chemotherapy alone
      (RR = 2.17, 95% CI = 1.51-3.12). Furthermore, concomitant use of chemotherapy
      with TKIs significantly improved the progression-free survival (PFS) when
      compared to the use of TKIs alone (HR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.49-0.95). Moreover,
      there was a higher ORR among patients who received combined treatment as compared
      to those who were managed using TKIs only (RR=1.17, 95%CI=1.09-1.25). Conclusion:
      Our meta-analysis shows that EGFR TKIs with chemotherapy confer better OS and ORR
      compared to either treatment alone, similarly, the combined treatment showed
      better PFS and ORR profiles than the use of TKI alone.

TI  - Prevalence of Dental Caries in the Indian Population: A Systematic Review and
      Meta-analysis.
PG  - 256-265
LID - 10.4103/jispcd.JISPCD_42_21 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the pooled prevalence of dental caries among Indian
      population through systematic review and meta-analysis. Materials and Methods: A 
      keyword search was conducted in PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, Cochrane,
      and Scopus databases using relevant key words to extract the data pertaining to
      dental caries in Indian population. The search criteria included manuscripts
      published in English language from March 2009 to March 2019 and employed standard
      Boolean operators. The studies which met the inclusion criteria were
      independently reviewed by two researchers and their quality was assessed by the
      Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The overall prevalence was deduced using the random
      effects model with prime focus given to the site of anatomical origin. R software
      version 3.5.2. was used for statistical analysis. Results: Post screening, out of
      the 253 articles identified, 70 met the inclusion criteria and were used to
      generate the meta-analysis. Among them, only few studies investigated the
      prevalence of root caries (n = 1). Overall prevalence of dental caries was 54.16%
      (CI: 0.4966-0.5866), whereas age-specific prevalence was 62% in patients above 18
      years and 52% among 3-18 years of age (P < 0.0001). Maximum overall prevalence
      was noted in mixed dentition (58%). Region wise prevalence was more in western
      India (72%). Use of decayed, missed, and filled teeth as diagnostic criteria for 
      early childhood caries was only 29%. Conclusions: Besides an overall prevalence
      of 54.16%, there exists a remarkable variation in dental caries prevalence rates 
      as per age, diagnostic criteria, dentition, and geographical region. Furthermore,
      research should be focused on the prevalence of anatomical site specific caries
      as well.

TI  - Influence of socioeconomic status on objective sleep measurement: A systematic
      review and meta-analysis of actigraphy studies.

AB  - Social inequities have many health effects; one of these is a potential
      relationship to sleep disturbances. Socioeconomic status (SES) is an important
      factor that contributes to social inequities. SES is a marker of living
      conditions and habits that influence health by way of different processes,
      including stress-related mechanisms. However, a systematic review of the
      relationship between SES and objectively measured sleep parameters has not been
      conducted. Therefore, a systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to
      examine the relationship between SES and sleep parameters measured with
      actigraphy in the general population. Nineteen articles were identified and
      included from a keyword search in Medline/PubMed, Web of Science, and SCOPUS,
      following PRISMA guidelines. For an article to be included, it had to have a
      measure of SES and also, an actigraphy-based measure of sleep. For, included
      studies, qualitative and quantitative data were extracted, and study quality was 
      assessed with The National Institute of Health's Quality Assessment Tool for
      Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies. Bivariate correlations were
      extracted and entered into a meta-analysis, along with a qualitative review of
      articles. These analyses revealed that SES was associated with sleep parameters
      in the predicted direction, with lower SES associated with worse sleep
      parameters. Specifically, lower SES was associated with lower total sleep time,
      longer sleep latency, greater sleep fragmentation, and higher variability in
      sleep onset and sleep latency. Higher education, higher perceived economic
      well-being, and higher income were significantly associated with improved sleep
      efficiency and longer sleep duration. For the 19 articles included, 10 were rated
      as fair or poor in study quality. Thus, higher quality studies in this area are
      needed. This meta-analysis and systematic review demonstrated that social
      inequities of sleep can be measured objectively, opening the path to the
      development and integration of methodologies combining actigraphy with current
      subjective measures for utilization in clinical practice.

TI  - Validated international definition of the thrombocytopenia, anasarca, fever,
      reticulin fibrosis, renal insufficiency, and organomegaly clinical subtype
      (TAFRO) of idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease.
PG  - 1241-1252
LID - 10.1002/ajh.26292 [doi]
AB  - Thrombocytopenia, anasarca, fever, reticulin fibrosis, renal insufficiency, and
      organomegaly (TAFRO) syndrome is a heterogeneous entity manifesting with a
      constellation of symptoms described above that can occur in the context of
      idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (iMCD) as well as infectious diseases, 
      malignancies, and rheumatologic disorders. So, iMCD-TAFRO is an aggressive
      subtype of iMCD with TAFRO syndrome and often hyper-vascularized lymph nodes.
      Since we proposed diagnostic criteria of iMCD-TAFRO in 2016, we have accumulated 
      new insights on the disorder and additional cases have been reported worldwide.
      In this systematic review and cohort analysis, we established and validated a
      definition for iMCD-TAFRO. First, we searched PubMed and Japan Medical Abstracts 
      Society databases using the keyword "TAFRO" to extract cases. Patients with
      possible systemic autoimmune diseases and hematologic malignancies were excluded.
      Our search identified 54 cases from 50 articles. We classified cases into three
      categories: (1) iMCD-TAFRO (TAFRO syndrome with lymph node histopathology
      consistent with iMCD), (2) possible iMCD-TAFRO (TAFRO syndrome with no lymph node
      biopsy performed and no other co-morbidities), and (3) TAFRO without iMCD or
      other co-morbidities (TAFRO syndrome with lymph node histopathology not
      consistent with iMCD or other comorbidities). Based on the findings, we propose
      an international definition requiring four clinical criteria (thrombocytopenia,
      anasarca, fever/hyperinflammatory status, organomegaly), renal dysfunction or
      characteristic bone marrow findings, and lymph node features consistent with
      iMCD. The definition was validated with an external cohort (the ACCELERATE
      Natural History Registry). The present international definition will facilitate a
      more precise and comprehensive approach to the diagnosis of iMCD-TAFRO.

AB  - As scientific evidence evolves and clinical guidelines change, a certain amount
      of conflicting health information in the news media is to be expected. However,
      research is needed to better understand the public's level of exposure to
      conflicting health information and the possible consequences of such exposure.
      This study quantifies levels of public exposure to one paradigmatic case:
      conflicting information about breast cancer screening for women in their 40s.
      Using a nationally-representative survey of U.S. adults aged 18-59 in 2016, we
      implemented four distinct types of measures of exposure to conflicting
      mammography information: an ecological measure based on keyword counts of local
      news closed-captioning, an inferred exposure measure based on a series of
      knowledge questions, a thought-listing exercise where respondents described their
      perceptions of mammography without prompting, and an explicit measure of
      self-assessed exposure to conflict. We examined the relationship between these
      exposure measures and four outcomes: confusion about mammography, backlash toward
      mammography recommendations, and confusion and backlash about health information 
      more generally. We found moderate amounts of exposure to conflicting information 
      about mammography, more among women than men. Exposure to conflicting information
      - across multiple measures - was associated with more confusion about
      mammography, more mammography-related backlash, and general health information
      backlash, but not general confusion about health information. These observational
      findings corroborate experimental-based findings that suggest potentially
      undesirable effects of exposure to conflicting health information. More research 
      is needed to better understand how to mitigate these possible outcomes, in the
      context of a media landscape that proliferates exposure to multiple scientific
      perspectives.

TI  - A scientometric study of unsafe behavior through Web of Science during 1991-2020.
PG  - 1-13
LID - 10.1080/10803548.2021.1953787 [doi]
AB  - Objectives. This scientometric study aimed to investigate research and hot topics
      on unsafe behavior. Methods. The study was performed using scientometric analysis
      mapping tools, such as CiteSpace, Gephi, MINITAB and VOSviewer, for statistical
      analysis. Studies published in Web of Science were included. Results. The first
      study was published in 1987. The results of the study showed that the Safety
      Science journal with 111 studies (10.45%) presented most of the published studies
      in this field. The USA and China were the two highest producing countries, with
      289 and 229 published studies, respectively. The results of keywords and hot
      topics showed that between 1991 and 2000 safety climate, safety performance and
      modeling were ranked as the first to third most frequent words, and during
      2001-2010 safety performance was removed from the list of top 10 keywords while
      safety climate and modeling were ranked, respectively, ninth and sixth most
      frequent. Finally, between 2011 and 2020, the keyword of organizational factors
      rose to first rank, indicating the significance of this keyword in the future.
      Conclusions. According to the results of the present study, it can be concluded
      that future studies on unsafe behavior can be conducted in the field of
      organizational factors.

TI  - Health insurance enrollment strategies during the Affordable Care Act (ACA): a
      scoping review on what worked and for whom.
PG  - 129
LID - 10.1186/s13690-021-00645-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Affordable Care Act (ACA) provided an opportunity for millions of
      people in the U.S. to get coverage from the publicly funded Medicaid program or
      private insurance from the newly established marketplace. However, enrolling
      millions of people for health insurance was an enormous task. The aim of this
      review was to examine the strategies used to enroll people for health insurance
      and their effectiveness after implementing the ACA's coverage expansion. METHODS:
      The PRISMA Extension for Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR) guided this review. Included
      studies were empirical studies that met the inclusion criteria and published
      between 2010 and 2020. Studies were searched mainly from two scholarly databases,
      CINAHL Plus and Medline (PubMed) using keyword searches. Hand searches from the
      references of selected journals were also performed. Content analysis was
      conducted by two authors in which codes were inductively developed to identify
      themes. RESULTS: There were 2213 potential studies identified from the search,
      but 10 met the inclusion criteria. The research design of the studies varied. Two
      studies were randomized trials, one quasi-experimental trial, three
      mixed-methods, two qualitative and two quantitative. All studies focused on
      strategies used to inform and help people enroll for either Medicaid or private
      insurance from the marketplace. This review identified three key strategies used 
      to help enroll people for coverage: 1) individual assistance; 2) community
      outreach; and 3) health education and promotion (HE&P). CONCLUSION:
      Community-based organizations were likely to use a combination of the three
      strategies simultaneously to reach uninsured individuals and directly help them
      enroll for health insurance. Other organizations that aimed to reach a wider
      segment of the population used single strategies, such as community outreach or
      HE&P.

AB  - Social, environmental, and behavioural factors impact human health. Integrating
      these social determinants of health (SDOH) into electronic health records (EHR)
      may improve individual and population health. But how these data are collectedand
      their use in clinical settings remain unclear. We reviewed efforts to integrate
      SDOH into EHR in the U.S. and Canada, especially how this implementation serves
      Indigenous peoples. We followed an established scoping review process, performing
      iterative keyword searches in subject-appropriate databases, reviewing identified
      works' bibliographies, and soliciting recommendations from subject-matter
      experts. We reviewed 20 articles from an initial set of 2,459. Most discussed
      multiple SDOH indicator standards, with the National Academy of Medicine's (NAM) 
      the most frequently cited (n = 10). Common SDOH domains were demographics,
      economics, education, environment, housing, psychosocial factors, and health
      behaviours. Twelve articles discussed project acceptability and feasibility;
      eight mentioned stakeholder engagement (none specifically discussed engaging
      ethnic or social minorities); and six adapted SDOH measures to local cultures .
      Linking SDOH data to EHR as related to Indigenous communities warrants further
      exploration, especially how to best align cultural strengths and community
      expectations with clinical priorities. Integrating SDOH data into EHR appears
      feasible and acceptable may improve patient care, patient-provider relationships,
      and health outcomes.

TI  - Blood transcriptional biomarkers of acute viral infection for detection of
      pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection: a nested, case-control diagnostic accuracy 
      study.
PG  - e508-e517
LID - 10.1016/S2666-5247(21)00146-4 [doi]
AB  - Background: We hypothesised that host-response biomarkers of viral infections
      might contribute to early identification of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2,
      which is critical to breaking the chains of transmission. We aimed to evaluate
      the diagnostic accuracy of existing candidate whole-blood transcriptomic
      signatures for viral infection to predict positivity of nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2
      PCR testing. Methods: We did a nested case-control diagnostic accuracy study
      among a prospective cohort of health-care workers (aged >/=18 years) at St
      Bartholomew's Hospital (London, UK) undergoing weekly blood and nasopharyngeal
      swab sampling for whole-blood RNA sequencing and SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing, when fit
      to attend work. We identified candidate blood transcriptomic signatures for viral
      infection through a systematic literature search. We searched MEDLINE for
      articles published between database inception and Oct 12, 2020, using
      comprehensive MeSH and keyword terms for "viral infection", "transcriptome",
      "biomarker", and "blood". We reconstructed signature scores in blood RNA
      sequencing data and evaluated their diagnostic accuracy for contemporaneous
      SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared with the gold standard of SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing, 
      by quantifying the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
      (AUROC), sensitivities, and specificities at a standardised Z score of at least 2
      based on the distribution of signature scores in test-negative controls. We used 
      pairwise DeLong tests compared with the most discriminating signature to identify
      the subset of best performing biomarkers. We evaluated associations between
      signature expression, viral load (using PCR cycle thresholds), and symptom status
      visually and using Spearman rank correlation. The primary outcome was the AUROC
      for discriminating between samples from participants who tested negative
      throughout the study (test-negative controls) and samples from participants with 
      PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (test-positive participants) during their
      first week of PCR positivity. Findings: We identified 20 candidate blood
      transcriptomic signatures of viral infection from 18 studies and evaluated their 
      accuracy among 169 blood RNA samples from 96 participants over 24 weeks.
      Participants were recruited between March 23 and March 31, 2020. 114 samples were
      from 41 participants with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 55 samples were from 55
      test-negative controls. The median age of participants was 36 years (IQR 27-47)
      and 69 (72%) of 96 were women. Signatures had little overlap of component genes, 
      but were mostly correlated as components of type I interferon responses. A single
      blood transcript for IFI27 provided the highest accuracy for discriminating
      between test-negative controls and test-positive individuals at the time of their
      first positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result, with AUROC of 0.95 (95% CI 0.91-0.99),
      sensitivity 0.84 (0.70-0.93), and specificity 0.95 (0.85-0.98) at a predefined
      threshold (Z score >2). The transcript performed equally well in individuals with
      and without symptoms. Three other candidate signatures (including two to 48
      transcripts) had statistically equivalent discrimination to IFI27 (AUROCs
      0.91-0.95). Interpretation: Our findings support further urgent evaluation and
      development of blood IFI27 transcripts as a biomarker for early phase SARS-CoV-2 
      infection for screening individuals at high risk of infection, such as contacts
      of index cases, to facilitate early case isolation and early use of antiviral
      treatments as they emerge. Funding: Barts Charity, Wellcome Trust, and National
      Institute of Health Research.

TI  - Impact of Clinician Recognition of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome on
      Evidenced-Based Interventions in the Medical ICU.
PG  - e0457
LID - 10.1097/CCE.0000000000000457 [doi]
AB  - Acute respiratory distress syndrome is underrecognized in the ICU, but it remains
      uncertain if acute respiratory distress syndrome recognition affects
      evidence-based acute respiratory distress syndrome care in the modern era. We
      sought to determine the rate of clinician-recognized acute respiratory distress
      syndrome in an academic medical ICU and understand how clinician-recognized-acute
      respiratory distress syndrome affects clinical care and patient-centered
      outcomes. DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: Single medical ICU at an
      academic tertiary-care hospital. PATIENTS: Nine hundred seventy-seven critically 
      ill adults (381 with expert-adjudicated acute respiratory distress syndrome)
      enrolled from 2006 to 2015. INTERVENTIONS: Clinician-recognized-acute respiratory
      distress syndrome was identified using an electronic keyword search of clinical
      notes in the electronic health record. We assessed the classification performance
      of clinician-recognized acute respiratory distress syndrome for identifying
      expert-adjudicated acute respiratory distress syndrome. We also compared
      differences in ventilator settings, diuretic prescriptions, and cumulative fluid 
      balance between clinician-recognized acute respiratory distress syndrome and
      unrecognized acute respiratory distress syndrome. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: 
      Overall, clinician-recognized-acute respiratory distress syndrome had a
      sensitivity of 47.5%, specificity 91.1%, positive predictive value 77.4%, and
      negative predictive value 73.1% for expert-adjudicated acute respiratory distress
      syndrome. Among the 381 expert-adjudicated acute respiratory distress syndrome
      cases, we did not observe any differences in ventilator tidal volumes between
      clinician-recognized-acute respiratory distress syndrome and unrecognized acute
      respiratory distress syndrome, but clinician-recognized-acute respiratory
      distress syndrome patients had a more negative cumulative fluid balance (mean
      difference, -781 mL; 95% CI, [-1,846 to +283]) and were more likely to receive
      diuretics (49.3% vs 35.7%, p = 0.02). There were no differences in mortality, ICU
      length of stay, or ventilator-free days. CONCLUSIONS: Acute respiratory distress 
      syndrome recognition was low in this single-center study. Although acute
      respiratory distress syndrome recognition was not associated with lower
      ventilator volumes, it was associated with differences in behaviors related to
      fluid management. These findings have implications for the design of future
      studies promoting evidence-based acute respiratory distress syndrome
      interventions in the ICU.

TI  - Comprehensive Bibliometric Analysis of the Kynurenine Pathway in Mood Disorders: 
      Focus on Gut Microbiota Research.
PG  - 687757
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2021.687757 [doi]
AB  - Background: Emerging evidence implicates the dysregulated kynurenine pathway
      (KP), an immune-inflammatory pathway, in the pathophysiology of mood disorders
      (MD), including depression and bipolar disorder characterized by a low-grade
      chronic pro-inflammatory state. The metabolites of the KP, an important part of
      the microbiota-gut-brain axis, serve as immune system modulators linking the gut 
      microbiota (GM) with the host central nervous system. Aim: This bibliometric
      analysis aimed to provide a first glimpse into the KP in MD, with a focus on GM
      research in this field, to guide future research and promote the development of
      this field. Methods: Publications relating to the KP in MD between the years 2000
      and 2020 were retrieved from the Scopus and Web of Science Core Collection
      (WoSCC), and analyzed in CiteSpace (5.7 R5W), biblioshiny (using R-Studio), and
      VOSviewer (1.6.16). Results: In total, 1,064 and 948 documents were extracted
      from the Scopus and WoSCC databases, respectively. The publications have shown
      rapid growth since 2006, partly owing to the largest research hotspot appearing
      since then, "quinolinic acid." All the top five most relevant journals were in
      the neuropsychiatry field, such as Brain Behavior and Immunity. The United States
      and Innsbruck Medical University were the most influential country and institute,
      respectively. Journal co-citation analysis showed a strong tendency toward
      co-citation of research in the psychiatry field. Reference co-citation analysis
      revealed that the top four most important research focuses were "kynurenine
      pathway," "psychoneuroimmunology," "indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase," and
      "proinflammatory cytokines," and the most recent focus was "gut-brain axis," thus
      indicating the role of the KP in bridging the GM and the host immune system, and 
      together reflecting the field's research foundations. Overlap analysis between
      the thematic map of keywords and the keyword burst analysis revealed that the
      topics "Alzheimer's disease," "prefrontal cortex," and "acid," were research
      frontiers. Conclusion: This comprehensive bibliometric study provides an updated 
      perspective on research associated with the KP in MD, with a focus on the current
      status of GM research in this field. This perspective may benefit researchers in 
      choosing suitable journals and collaborators, and aid in the further
      understanding of the field's hotspots and frontiers, thus facilitating future
      research.

TI  - Global trends and hotspots in research of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae
      (CRE): a bibliometric analysis from 2010 to 2020.
PG  - 6079-6091
LID - 10.21037/apm-21-87 [doi]
LID - apm-21-87 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infectious disease caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae 
      (CRE) has become one of the most serious challenges due to its high morbidity and
      mortality and research on it has aroused great concern worldwide in the last
      decade. Thus, a bibliometric analysis of relevant publications is needed to
      identify the situation of current investigations and prioritize the future
      research areas. METHODS: The current study retrieved articles related to CRE
      published between 2010 and 2020 from the Web of Science core collection database.
      The search strategy syntax included "carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae",
      "carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae", "carbapenemase producing
      Enterobacteriaceae" and "carbapenemase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae" which
      were searched in both Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and titles. A bibliometric 
      analysis was conducted using VOSviewer, Bibliographic Item Co-Occurrence Matrix
      Builder, gCLUTO and other machine learning tools. Key words, subject terms,
      contributions as well as collaborations were assessed. Moreover, hot off the
      press and future research trends were demonstrated. RESULTS: A total of 1,671
      publications on CRE were finally included in the bibliometric analysis and 5
      related theme clusters were identified which mainly focused on epidemiology,
      resistance mechanisms, antibiotics treatment and infection control. A total of
      142 keywords occurred more than 5 times and the most frequent keyword was
      "carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae" with 247 occurrences and a total link
      strength of 559. The output on CRE has gradually increased during the last
      decade, and the USA has made the greatest contribution due to the 533 research
      papers. Agents that act against CRE, especially ceftazidime-avibactam
      (occurrences, 85; average publication year, 2018.26), and the early detection of 
      CRE by genome sequencing techniques (occurrences, 97; average publication year,
      2017.94) were emerging hot topics which would probably attract future research
      interest. CONCLUSIONS: The bibliometric analysis revealed that development of
      antibacterial agents, early etiological detection and genome sequencing
      techniques were the hotspots and would probably direct the future research
      directions which would also facilitate a better understanding of the epidemiology
      of drug-resistant bacteria and implementing the antibiotic stewardship program.

AB  - Curcumin, isolated from Curcuma longa L., is a fat-soluble natural compound that 
      can be obtained from ginger plant tuber roots, which accumulative evidences have 
      demonstrated that it can resist viral and microbial infection and has anti-tumor,
      reduction of blood lipid and blood glucose, antioxidant and removal of free
      radicals, and is active against numerous disorders various chronic diseases
      including cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurological and autoimmune diseases. In
      this article is highlighted the recent evidence of curcuminoids applied in sevral
      aspects of medical problem particular in COVID-19 pandemics. We have searched
      several literature databases including MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, the Web of
      Science, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and the ClinicalTrials.gov website via
      using curcumin and medicinal properties as a keyword. All studies published from 
      the time when the database was established to May 2021 was retrieved. This review
      article summarizes the growing confirmation for the mechanisms related to
      curcumin's physiological and pharmacological effects with related target proteins
      interaction via molecular docking. The purpose is to provide deeper insight and
      understandings of curcumin's medicinal value in the discovery and development of 
      new drugs. Curcumin could be used in the prevention or therapy of cardiovascular 
      disease, respiratory diseases, cancer, neurodegeneration, infection, and
      inflammation based on cellular biochemical, physiological regulation, infection
      suppression and immunomodulation.

TI  - The Unified Medical Language System at 30 Years and How It Is Used and Published:
      Systematic Review and Content Analysis.
PG  - e20675
LID - 10.2196/20675 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) has been a critical tool
      in biomedical and health informatics, and the year 2021 marks its 30th
      anniversary. The UMLS brings together many broadly used vocabularies and
      standards in the biomedical field to facilitate interoperability among different 
      computer systems and applications. OBJECTIVE: Despite its longevity, there is no 
      comprehensive publication analysis of the use of the UMLS. Thus, this review and 
      analysis is conducted to provide an overview of the UMLS and its use in
      English-language peer-reviewed publications, with the objective of providing a
      comprehensive understanding of how the UMLS has been used in English-language
      peer-reviewed publications over the last 30 years. METHODS: PubMed, ACM Digital
      Library, and the Nursing & Allied Health Database were used to search for
      studies. The primary search strategy was as follows: UMLS was used as a Medical
      Subject Headings term or a keyword or appeared in the title or abstract. Only
      English-language publications were considered. The publications were screened
      first, then coded and categorized iteratively, following the grounded theory. The
      review process followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
      Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 943 publications were 
      included in the final analysis. Moreover, 32 publications were categorized into 2
      categories; hence the total number of publications before duplicates are removed 
      is 975. After analysis and categorization of the publications, UMLS was found to 
      be used in the following emerging themes or areas (the number of publications and
      their respective percentages are given in parentheses): natural language
      processing (230/975, 23.6%), information retrieval (125/975, 12.8%), terminology 
      study (90/975, 9.2%), ontology and modeling (80/975, 8.2%), medical subdomains
      (76/975, 7.8%), other language studies (53/975, 5.4%), artificial intelligence
      tools and applications (46/975, 4.7%), patient care (35/975, 3.6%), data mining
      and knowledge discovery (25/975, 2.6%), medical education (20/975, 2.1%),
      degree-related theses (13/975, 1.3%), digital library (5/975, 0.5%), and the UMLS
      itself (150/975, 15.4%), as well as the UMLS for other purposes (27/975, 2.8%).
      CONCLUSIONS: The UMLS has been used successfully in patient care, medical
      education, digital libraries, and software development, as originally planned, as
      well as in degree-related theses, the building of artificial intelligence tools, 
      data mining and knowledge discovery, foundational work in methodology, and middle
      layers that may lead to advanced products. Natural language processing, the UMLS 
      itself, and information retrieval are the 3 most common themes that emerged among
      the included publications. The results, although largely related to academia,
      demonstrate that UMLS achieves its intended uses successfully, in addition to
      achieving uses broadly beyond its original intentions.

TI  - Global trends of textile waste research from 2005 to 2020 using bibliometric
      analysis.
PG  - 44780-44794
LID - 10.1007/s11356-021-15303-5 [doi]
AB  - Researchers have broadly studied textile waste, but the research topics
      development and performance trends in this study area are still unclear. A
      bibliometric analysis was conducted to explore the global scientific literature
      to determine state of the art on textile waste over the past 16 years. Data of
      publications output are identified based on the Web of Science (from 2015 to
      2020). This study used VOSviewer to analyse collaboration networks among authors,
      countries, institutions, and author's keywords in identifying five main clusters.
      A total of 3296 papers in textile waste research were identified. In this study, 
      a total of 10451 authors were involved in textile waste research, and 36 authors 
      among them published more than ten research publications in the period of this
      study. China has been in a top position in textile waste research moving from 3
      output publications in 2005 to 91 output publications in 2020. Indian Institute
      of Technology System IIT System was ranked first in terms of the total
      publication number (85 publications, 2.45%). Textile wastewater and adsorption
      are the most commonly used keywords that reflect the current main research
      direction in this field and received more attention in recent years. Based on
      keyword cluster analysis outputs, textile waste research can be categorized into 
      five types of clusters, namely (1) pollutant compositions, (2) component of
      textile wastewater, (3) treatment methods for textile wastewater, (4) effect
      mechanism of textile wastewater, and (5) recyclability of textile waste.

TI  - Trends in HSPB5 research: a 36-year bibliometric analysis.
PG  - 799-810
LID - 10.1007/s12192-021-01220-6 [doi]
AB  - HSPB5 (heat shock protein B5), also known as alphaB-crystallin, is one of the
      most widespread and populous of the ten human small heat shock proteins (sHsps). 
      Over the past decades, extensive research has been conducted on HSPB5. However,
      few studies have statistically analyzed these publications. Herein, we conducted 
      a bibliometric analysis to track the global research trend and current
      development status of HSPB5 research from the Web of Science Core Collection
      (WoSCC) database between 1985 and 2020. Our results demonstrate that 1220
      original articles cited 54,778 times in 391 scholarly journals were published.
      Visualization analyses reveal that the Journal of Biological Chemistry was the
      most influential journal with 85 articles. The USA dominated this field with 520 
      publications (42.62%), followed by Japan with 149 publications (12.21%), and Kato
      contributed the largest number of publications. Most related publications were
      published in journals focusing on biochemistry molecular biology, cell biology,
      neurosciences neurology, and ophthalmology. In addition, keyword co-occurrence
      analyses identify three predominant research topics: expression of HSPB5,
      chaperone studies for HSPB5, and pathological studies of HSPB5. This study
      provides valuable guidance for researchers and leads to collaborative
      opportunities between diverse research interests to be integrated for HSPB5
      research.

TI  - The Top 100 Cited Papers in the Field of Iron Deficiency in Humans: A
      Bibliometric Study.
PG  - 5573790
LID - 10.1155/2021/5573790 [doi]
AB  - Worldwide, iron deficiency is a common form of micronutrient deficiency with a
      high individual and societal cost. There are considerable knowledge and practice 
      gaps in the diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency. Bibliometric analysis
      examines the published body of knowledge of a subject in an objective fashion.
      The Web of Science Core Collection was searched to retrieve the 100 most cited
      papers on the topic of iron deficiency, and the key metrics of each paper were
      extracted. A keyword study was performed using VOSviewer 1.6.10 software, which
      provided a visual mapping of the network of keyword cooccurrences. The papers
      were published between 1964 and 2017 and were cited an average of 636 times. They
      were contributed by authors from 119 different countries/regions, with the
      largest contributing country being the United States. 29 institutions contributed
      at least 6 publications each, and 4 researchers authored or coauthored at least 5
      papers. Keyword analysis suggests that the most cited topics could be grouped
      into 4 categories: (1) epidemiologic research of the global burden of iron
      deficiency, (2) clinical aspects of iron deficiency anemia, (3) iron metabolism, 
      and (4) the impact of iron deficiency on children. Identification of the most
      impactful studies in the field of iron deficiency may be helpful to practitioners
      interested in improving their knowledge base. Compared to bibliometric studies
      performed on other topics, the medical literature of iron deficiency is mature,
      as evidenced by the high citation rate of the top 100 papers. Despite the high
      worldwide prevalence of iron deficiency, the top cited papers are dominated by a 
      relatively small number of countries and institutions. Interestingly, however,
      the most cited authors in this study do not overlap with the most cited
      institutions.

      literature on acupuncture for migraine in the Web of Science database from 2000
      to 2019, and then resorted to CiteSpace to conduct bibliometric analysis to
      attain the knowledge mapping. Results: The total number of publications each year
      has increased year by year, and the average annual growth rate from 2000 to 2009 
      was 15.57%, while from 2010 to 2019 was 6.35%, with a faster growth rate from
      2000 to 2009. According to the cluster analysis of institutions, authors, cited
      references, and keywords, 10, 7, 12, and 10 categories were gained from 2000 to
      2019. The most productive countries, institutions, and authors are the USA and
      China, Technical University of Munich and Beijing University of Chinese Medicine,
      Linde K and Liang FR from 2000 to 2019, whose frequency is 119/103, 28/24, and
      28/24, respectively. However, the most important of them are Canada, Sichuan
      University, and Witt CM. Owing to their highest centrality, they are 0.86, 0.54, 
      and 0.27 separately. Moreover, cited references that contributed to the most
      co-citations are Linde K (2005), yet, the most vital cited reference is Karst M
      (2001). Keywords such as migraine, acupuncture, headache, pain, and randomized
      controlled trial are the most frequently used. However, needle acupuncture is the
      crucial keyword. In the cluster analysis of institutions, authors, cited
      references, and keywords from 2000 to 2019, the largest cluster categories are #0
      migraine prophylaxis, #1 randomized controlled trial, #0 episodic migraine, and
      #0 topiramate treatment. Then, randomized controlled trials of acupuncture
      prevention and treatment of migraine are the most important research content in
      this field. Conclusion: Through the bibliometric analysis of the research on
      acupuncture for migraine in the Web of Science database in the past 20 years, the
      trends and the Knowledge Graph of the country, institution, author, cited
      reference, and the keyword are acquired, which have an important guiding
      significance for quickly and accurately positioning the key information in the
      field.

TI  - Clinical Implications of Bone Bruise Patterns Accompanying Anterior Cruciate
      Ligament Tears.
PG  - 19417381211029583
LID - 10.1177/19417381211029583 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are common injuries; they are 
      often associated with concomitant injuries to other structures in the knee,
      including bone bruises. While there is limited evidence that bone bruises are
      associated with slightly worse clinical outcomes, the implications of bone
      bruises for the articular cartilage and the risk of developing osteoarthritis
      (OA) in the knee are less clear. Recent studies suggest that the bone bruise
      pattern may be helpful in predicting the presence of meniscal ramp lesions.
      EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A literature review was performed in EMBASE using the
      keyword search phrase (acl OR (anterior AND cruciate AND ligament)) AND ((bone
      AND bruise) OR (bone AND contusion) OR (bone AND marrow AND edema) OR (bone AND
      marrow AND lesion) OR (subchondral AND edema)). STUDY DESIGN: Clinical review.
      LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 4. RESULTS: The literature search returned 93 articles
      of which 25 were ultimately included in this review. Most studies identified a
      high prevalence of bone bruises in the setting of acute ACL injury. Individual
      studies have found relationships between bone bruise volume and functional
      outcomes; however, these results were not supported by systematic review.
      Similarly, the literature has contradictory findings on the relationship between 
      bone bruises and the progression of OA after ACL reconstruction. Investigations
      into concomitant injury found anterolateral ligament and meniscal ramp lesions to
      be associated with bone bruise presence on magnetic resonance imaging.
      CONCLUSION: Despite the ample literature identifying the prevalence of bone
      bruises in association with ACL injury, there is little evidence to correlate
      bone bruises to functional outcomes or progression of OA. Bone bruises may best
      be used as a marker for concomitant injury such as medial meniscal ramp lesions
      that are not always well visualized on magnetic resonance imaging. Further
      research is required to establish the longitudinal effects of bone bruises on ACL
      tear recovery. STRENGTH OF RECOMMENDATION TAXONOMY: 2.

TI  - Integrating the precision, sleep, and aerospace medicine fields: a systematic
      review of the genetic predisposition for obstructive sleep apnea in military
      aviation.
LID - 10.1007/s11325-021-02427-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common pathologic sleep
      disorder with an estimated prevalence in the USA of up to 25% of adult males.
      With military aviation being heavily comprised of adult men, the impact of OSA on
      flying operations is concerning as OSA is disqualifying for all flying classes in
      the US Air Force. In order to minimize the impact of OSA on operations, early
      identification of at-risk patients is critical in disease management. Individuals
      could be identified for whom regular polysomnography testing may reveal OSA while
      mild or sub-clinical, at which point treatment may be initiated in order to
      promote continued medical qualification for duty and career retention. METHODS:
      We performed a keyword search of PubMed, EMBASE, and Google Scholar along with
      searches in the NHGRI/EBI GWAS Catalogue and the Atlas of GWAS Summary
      Statistics. We included primary research from candidate gene, GWAS, and
      meta-analyses. We also included other review articles in our search to confirm
      interpretations and implications of any genetic associations with OSA. Only
      studies related to OSA susceptibility or risk were included. RESULTS: We
      identified 134 publications reporting or reviewing genetic associations with OSA 
      risk. These papers reported 301 variants, of which 195 were unique and 33 were
      replicated in at least two papers. With respect to the strength of association,
      43 variants exhibited odds ratios greater than 2. Finally, there were 84 null
      results reported, 51 of which were in conflict with reported associations.
      CONCLUSION: There is ample evidence in the literature to confirm that genetics
      provide an important contribution to OSA development. The high number of strongly
      associated variants suggests that a polygenic risk model could be created with
      high predictive value for prognostic screening.

TI  - Nanoparticles and nanoformulated drugs as promising delivery system in treatment 
      of microbial-induced CNS infection: a systematic review of literature.
PG  - 542-549
LID - 10.1007/s13365-021-00994-w [doi]
AB  - Central nervous system (CNS) infection is a global health problem with high rate 
      of mortality and associated morbidities. Viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa
      parasites are the main cause of CNS infection. Various medications are currently 
      used for treatment of brain infections, but most of them do not have enough
      efficiency because the majority of conventional drugs cannot pass the blood-brain
      barrier (BBB) to combat the pathogens. Nanotechnology has provided promising
      approaches to solve this issue, since nanoparticles (NPs) can facilitate the
      drugs entrance through the BBB. Herein, we systematically reviewed all available 
      literature to provide evidences for practicality of NPs in treatment of CNS
      infection. A systematic literature search was performed on January 29, 2021, in
      Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, Embase, Ovid, and Google Scholar 
      using "CNS infections" and "NPs/nanoformulation" including all their equivalent
      terms as keyword. Due to lack of human studies, no strict inclusion criteria were
      defined, and all relevant documents were included. After several steps of article
      selection, a total of 29 documents were collected and used for data synthesis.
      The results showed that drug-loaded NPs is fairly safe and can be a promising
      approach in developing anti-infective agents for treatment of CNS infection,
      since nanoformulated drugs could act up to tenfold more efficient that drug
      alone. Findings of this review indicate the importance of NPs and nanoformulation
      of drugs to enhance the efficiency of treatment and warrant the safety of
      treatment in human studies; however, clinical trials are required to confirm such
      efficiency and safety in clinical practice.

TI  - Costs of implementing community-based intervention for HIV testing in sub-Saharan
      Africa: a systematic review.
PG  - 73
LID - 10.1186/s43058-021-00177-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Community-based interventions (CBIs) are interventions aimed at
      improving the well-being of people in a community. CBIs for HIV testing seek to
      increase the availability of testing services to populations that have been
      identified as at high risk by reaching them in homes, schools, or community
      centers. However, evidence for a detailed cost analysis of these community-based 
      interventions in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is limited. We conducted a systematic
      review of the cost analysis of HIV testing interventions in SSA. METHODS: Keyword
      search was conducted on SCOPUS, CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and
      Global Health databases. Three categories of key terms used were cost
      (implementation cost OR cost-effectiveness OR cost analysis OR cost-benefit OR
      marginal cost), intervention (HIV testing), and region (sub-Saharan Africa OR
      sub-Saharan Africa OR SSA). CBI studies were included if they primarily focused
      on HIV testing, was implemented in SSA, and used micro-costing or ingredients
      approach. RESULTS: We identified 1533 citations. After screening, ten studies
      were included in the review: five from East Africa and five from Southern Africa.
      Two studies conducted cost-effectiveness analysis, and one study was a
      cost-utility analysis. The remainder seven studies were cost analyses. Four
      intervention types were identified: HIV self-testing (HIVST), home-based, mobile,
      and Provider Initiated Testing and Counseling. Commonly costed resources included
      personnel (n = 9), materials and equipment (n = 6), and training (n = 5). Cost
      outcomes reported included total intervention cost (n = 9), cost per HIV test (n 
      = 9), cost per diagnosis (n = 5), and cost per linkage to care (n = 3). Overall, 
      interventions were implemented at a higher cost than controls, with the largest
      cost difference with HIVST compared to facility-based testing. CONCLUSION: To
      better inform policy, there is an urgent need to evaluate the costs associated
      with implementing CBIs in SSA. It is important for cost reports to be detailed,
      uniform, and informed by economic evaluation guidelines. This approach minimizes 
      biases that may lead decision-makers to underestimate the resources required to
      scale up, sustain, or reproduce successful interventions in other settings. In an
      evolving field of implementation research, this review contributes to current
      resources on implementation cost studies.

      Review and Meta-synthesis.
PG  - 21-34
LID - 10.1177/10598405211026300 [doi]
AB  - Schools often provide medication management to children at school, yet, most U.S.
      schools lack a full-time, licensed nurse. Schools rely heavily on unlicensed
      assistive personnel (UAP) to perform such tasks. This systematic review examined 
      medication management among K-12 school nurses. Keyword searches in three
      databases were performed. We included studies that examined: (a) K-12 charter,
      private/parochial, or public schools, (b) UAPs and licensed nurses, (c) policies 
      and practices for medication management, or (d) nurse delegation laws. Three
      concepts were synthesized: (a) level of training, (b) nurse delegation, and (c)
      emergency medications. One-hundred twelve articles were screened. Of these, 37.5%
      (42/112) were comprehensively reviewed. Eighty-one percent discussed level of
      training, 69% nurse delegation, and 57% emergency medications. Succinct and
      consistent policies within and across the United States aimed at increasing
      access to emergency medications in schools remain necessary.

TI  - Role of theories in school-based diabetes care interventions: A critical review.
PG  - 4709-4720
LID - 10.12998/wjcc.v9.i18.4709 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes is one of the most common chronic diseases of childhood.
      School plays an essential role in the management of student diabetes, which
      reduces the risk of short- and long-term diabetes complications and ensures that 
      students are well-positioned for optimal academic performance and growth. AIM:
      The aim of this review was to systematically identify and synthesize the
      literature concerning theory-based diabetes care interventions in K-12 schools in
      the United States. It critically assessed the specific role of theories and
      associated essential constructs in intervention design, implementation, outcome
      measurement, and evaluation. METHODS: Relevant literature was identified by
      keyword searches of the Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Web of Science. RESULTS:
      Four interventions met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. 
      Of those, two evaluated online diabetes education programs for school personnel
      and the other two assessed in-person interventions. Three studies adopted a
      one-group pre-post study design, and the remaining one adopted a one-shot
      case-study design. Three of the interventions adopted social cognitive theory,
      and the remaining one was guided by the diffusion of innovations theory. Three
      studies identified core constructs of a theory as predictors of behavioral
      change. Two used theory to select or develop intervention techniques. Two studies
      used theory to customize participant intervention techniques. Two studies
      discussed their findings in the context of theory. No study used theory to select
      potential intervention participants. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, despite the value
      of theory in intervention design and evaluation, theory-based diabetes
      interventions at school remain scarce. Future research may seek ways to better
      integrate theory and empirical research.

      Alcohol Dependence.
PG  - 257-265
LID - 10.1007/s12291-020-00933-2 [doi]
AB  - Catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) enzyme catalyzes the metabolism of dopamine 
      and other catechols in the brain. Several articles investigated
      catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val158Met polymorphism as risk factor for
      alcohol dependence (AD) but the results were inconclusive. The aim of present
      meta-analysis was to evaluate the association of Val158Met (COMT) polymorphism
      with AD. Authors performed keyword search of the 4 electronic databases-Pubmed,
      Google Scholar, Springer Link and Science Direct databases up to December 31,
      2019. Total eighteen studies that investigated the association of Val158Met
      polymorphism with AD were retrieved. The pooled results from the meta-analysis
      (2278 AD cases and 3717 healthy controls) did not show association with AD using 
      all 5 genetic models (allele contrast model: OR = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.90-1.14, p =
      0.03; homozygote model: OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 0.81-1.38, p = 0.69; dominant model: 
      OR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.85-1.14, p = 0.87; co-dominant model: OR = 0.97, 95% CI =
      0.86-1.11, p = 0.71; recessive model: OR = 1.05;95% CI = 0.85-1.29, p = 0.61).
      Results of subgroup analysis showed that Val158Met is not risk for AD in Asian
      and Caucasian population. In conclusion, COMT Val158Met is not a risk factor for 
      alcohol dependence.

TI  - Metric Evaluation of Reliability and Transparency of the Videos About Carpal
      Tunnel Syndrome Surgery in the Online Platforms: Assessment of YouTube Videos'
      Content.
PG  - 363-368
LID - 10.14245/ns.2142030.015 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the quality and reliability of carpal tunnel syndrome
      surgery videos on YouTube. METHODS: A keyword set of "carpal tunnel syndrome
      surgery" was searched on YouTube. The DISCERN scoring system, Journal of the
      American Medical Association (JAMA) scoring system, and Health on the Net (HON)
      ranking systems were used to evaluate the quality and reliability of the first 50
      videos appeared in the search results. The characteristics of each video, such as
      the number of likes, dislikes and views, upload days, video length, and the
      uploader, were collected retrospectively. The relationships between the video
      quality and these factors were investigated statistically. RESULTS: All of the
      featured videos sorted were found to be of poor content (mean DISCERN score [n = 
      1.71 of 5], mean JAMA score [n = 1.76 of 4], mean HON score [n = 5.65 of 16]).
      Yet, DISCERN scores of the videos uploaded by medical centers were higher than
      that of the others (p = 0.022). No relationship was detected between the other
      variables and video quality. CONCLUSION: Healthcare professionals and
      organizations should be more cautious when recording and uploading a video to the
      online platforms. As those videos could reach a wide audience, their content
      should provide more information about possible complications of a treatment and
      other treatment modalities.

AB  - Municipal wastewaters are abundant low-strength streams that require adequate
      treatment and disposal to ensure public and environmental health. This study aims
      to provide a comprehensive summary of municipal wastewater research in Europe in 
      the 2010s in the form of bibliometric analysis. The work was based on the Science
      Citation Index Expanded (Web of Science) and carried out using the R-package
      bibliometrix for bibliometric data analysis and the software VOSviewer for
      science mapping. Analysing a dataset of 5645 publications, we identified the most
      influential journals, countries, authors, institutions, and publications, and
      mapped the co-authorship and keyword co-occurrence networks. Spain had produced
      the most publications while Switzerland had the highest average citations per
      publication. China was the most collaborative country from outside of Europe.
      Analysis of the most cited articles revealed the popularity of micropollutant
      removal in European municipal wastewater research. The keyword analysis
      visualized a paradigm shift from pollutant removal towards resource recovery and 
      circular economy. We found that current challenges of resource recovery from
      municipal wastewater come from both technical and non-technical (e.g.,
      environmental, economic, and social) aspects. We also discussed future research
      opportunities that can tackle these challenges.

AB  - Apolipoprotein E (apoE, protein; APOE, gene) involves in cholesterol recycling
      and redistribution by mediating lipoprotein pathways unique to central nervous
      system (CNS), which is a potential therapeutic target for diseases. We visually
      analyzed the research hotspots of APOE related to CNS in this work, by
      scientometric analysis from the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC) database
      over the past two decades. A total of 25,719 references of "APOE" and 836
      references of "APOE in CNS" were retrieved from the WOSCC on October 26, 2020,
      and then VOSviewer 1.6.15, Citespace 5.7.R2 were used for visual analysis. Over
      the last two decades, the research on the field of APOE in CNS is not faddish.
      Although many funds, organizations, and scholars were affiliated in this field,
      organizations and scholars, especially the top teams in this field, still lacked 
      close cooperation with other teams around the world. Few articles with high
      citations had been published in the last decade, but recent studies still lacked 
      scale and breakthrough, and the keywords associated with APOE appeared more
      outdated. However, the current researches have not fully elucidated the crosstalk
      between APOE and neuroinflammation in CNS, some new ideas may rekindle the
      research enthusiasm of scholars. Although the field of APOE in CNS appeared more 
      outdated. Based on keyword analysis, we hypothesized new ideas for further
      investigation of neuroinflammation would light the interest of APOE in CNS for
      the scholars. The crosstalk between ApoE and inflammasome may be the focus of
      future researches. How APOE modulates the time course or intensity of the
      inflammasome activation, inflammatory response (proinflammatory or
      anti-inflammatory), and pathological process of CNS disease deserves future
      attention in both basic and clinical studies. More apoE/APOE-targeted
      pharmacological interventions will be available for preclinical experiments and
      clinical trials and bring hope for patients with CNS diseases.

TI  - Characteristics of Publications on Occupational Stress: Contributions and Trends.
PG  - 664013
LID - 10.3389/fpubh.2021.664013 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to analyze the bibliometric characteristics of the publications 
      on occupational stress and highlight key research topics and future trends. The
      Web of Science Core Collection database was searched to collect publications on
      occupational stress, from inception to December 9, 2020. Two authors
      independently screened eligible literature and extracted the data. Bibliometric
      analyses were performed using VOSviewer 1.6.6 and R 3.6.3 software. Overall,
      6,564 publications on occupational stress were included. "Stress," with a total
      link strength of 1,252, appeared as the most co-occurrence keyword, followed by
      "occupational stress," "job stress," and "job satisfaction." All studies were
      published between 1956 and 2020. Among them, 6,176 (94.35%) papers were written
      in English, and 4,706 (70.25%) were original articles. The top three Web of
      Science categories were "public environmental occupational health" (n = 1,711),
      "psychology, applied" (n = 846), and "psychology, multidisciplinary" (n = 650).
      The 100 top-cited articles were mentioned a total of 36,145 times, with a median 
      of 361, ranging from 174 to 5,574. The United States was the most productive
      country, with 1,780 publications. The main partners of the United States were
      England and China. Three themes of occupational stress research were identified: 
      job satisfaction, burnout, and occupational stress-related health problems. This 
      bibliometric analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the trends and
      most influential contributions to the field of occupational stress, thus
      promoting ideas for future research.

TI  - New Evidence of Potential Benefits of Dexamethasone and Added on Therapy of
      Fludrocortisone on Clinical Outcomes of Corticosteroid in Sepsis Patients: A
      Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
LID - 544 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jpm11060544 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate clinical outcomes of corticosteroid
      treatment in patients with sepsis or septic shock. An electronic keyword searches
      of PubMed, EMBASE, and Google Scholar were conducted per PRISMA guidelines. The
      pooled analyses on the corticosteroid impact on mortality, adverse events, and
      clinical outcomes were performed. Subgroup analyses on the clinical outcomes in
      relation to corticosteroid dose, duration, and agents were performed. Pooled
      analyses of 21 randomized control trials revealed substantially reduced mortality
      (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88-0.99, p = 0.02) and length of stay in intensive care unit
      (SMD -1.66, 95% CI -1.91--1.40, p < 0.00001) without increased risks of adverse
      events (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.96-1.12, p = 0.38). No significant improvements of
      other clinical outcomes were observed. Subgroup analyses demonstrated
      substantially reduced mortality with short-term (</=7 days) low-dose (<400
      mg/day) corticosteroid treatment (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.87-0.95, p < 0.0001).
      Moreover, dexamethasone (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.20-0.81, p = 0.01) and combined
      hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone treatment (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.84-0.94, p <
      0.00001) provided substantial reduction of mortality whereas hydrocortisone alone
      did not reduce the mortality risk in sepsis patients. Thus, further controlled
      studies on the clinical outcomes of potential corticosteroid options on
      sepsis-related clinical outcomes are warranted.

TI  - A Bibliometric Analysis of Fragility Fractures: Top 50.
LID - 639 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/medicina57060639 [doi]
AB  - Background and Objectives: The population is aging and fragility fractures are a 
      research topic of steadily growing importance. Therefore, a systematic
      bibliometric review was performed to identify the 50 most cited articles in the
      field of fragility fractures analyzing their qualities and characteristics.
      Materials and Methods: From the Core Collection database in the Thomson Reuters
      Web of Knowledge, the most influential original articles with reference to
      fragility fractures were identified in February 2021 using a multistep approach. 
      Year of publication, total number of citations, average number of citations per
      year since year of publication, affiliation of first and senior author,
      geographic origin of study population, keywords, and level of evidence were of
      interest. Results: Articles were published in 26 different journals between 1997 
      and 2020. The number of total citations per article ranged from 12 to 129
      citations. In the majority of publications, orthopedic surgeons and
      traumatologists (66%) accounted for the first authorship, articles mostly
      originated from Europe (58%) and the keyword mostly used was "hip fracture". In
      total, 38% of the articles were therapeutic studies level III followed by
      prognostic studies level I. Only two therapeutic studies with level I could be
      identified. Conclusions: This bibliometric review shows the growing interest in
      fragility fractures and raises awareness that more high quality and
      interdisciplinary studies are needed.

TI  - Scientometric Analysis and Systematic Review of Multi-Material Additive
      Manufacturing of Polymers.
LID - 1957 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/polym13121957 [doi]
AB  - Multi-material additive manufacturing of polymers has experienced a remarkable
      increase in interest over the last 20 years. This technology can rapidly design
      and directly fabricate three-dimensional (3D) parts with multiple materials
      without complicating manufacturing processes. This research aims to obtain a
      comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the current state of research and
      reveal challenges and opportunities for future research in the area. To achieve
      the goal, this study conducts a scientometric analysis and a systematic review of
      the global research published from 2000 to 2021 on multi-material additive
      manufacturing of polymers. In the scientometric analysis, a total of 2512 journal
      papers from the Scopus database were analyzed by evaluating the number of
      publications, literature coupling, keyword co-occurrence, authorship, and
      countries/regions activities. By doing so, the main research frame, articles, and
      topics of this research field were quantitatively determined. Subsequently, an
      in-depth systematic review is proposed to provide insight into recent advances in
      multi-material additive manufacturing of polymers in the aspect of technologies
      and applications, respectively. From the scientometric analysis, a heavy bias was
      found towards studying materials in this field but also a lack of focus on
      developing technologies. The future trend is proposed by the systematic review
      and is discussed in the directions of interfacial bonding strength, printing
      efficiency, and microscale/nanoscale multi-material 3D printing. This study
      contributes by providing knowledge for practitioners and researchers to
      understand the state of the art of multi-material additive manufacturing of
      polymers and expose its research needs, which can serve both academia and
      industry.

TI  - IoU Regression with H+L-Sampling for Accurate Detection Confidence.
LID - 4433 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s21134433 [doi]
AB  - It is a common paradigm in object detection frameworks that the samples in
      training and testing have consistent distributions for the two main tasks:
      Classification and bounding box regression. This paradigm is popular in sampling 
      strategy for training an object detector due to its intuition and practicability.
      For the task of localization quality estimation, there exist two ways of
      sampling: The same sampling with the main tasks and the uniform sampling by
      manually augmenting the ground-truth. The first method of sampling is simple but 
      inconsistent for the task of quality estimation. The second method of uniform
      sampling contains all IoU level distributions but is more complex and difficult
      for training. In this paper, we propose an H+L-Sampling strategy, selecting the
      high and low IoU samples simultaneously, to effectively and simply train the
      branch of quality estimation. This strategy inherits the effectiveness of
      consistent sampling and reduces the training difficulty of uniform sampling.
      Finally, we introduce accurate detection confidence, which combines the
      classification probability and the localization accuracy, as the ranking keyword 
      of NMS. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method in solving the
      misalignment between classification confidence and localization accuracy and
      improving the detection performance.

TI  - Mining Proteome Research Reports: A Bird's Eye View.
LID - 29 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/proteomes9020029 [doi]
AB  - The complexity of data has burgeoned to such an extent that scientists of every
      realm are encountering the incessant challenge of data management. Modern-day
      analytical approaches with the help of free source tools and programming
      languages have facilitated access to the context of the various domains as well
      as specific works reported. Here, with this article, an attempt has been made to 
      provide a systematic analysis of all the available reports at PubMed on Proteome 
      using text mining. The work is comprised of scientometrics as well as information
      extraction to provide the publication trends as well as frequent keywords,
      bioconcepts and most importantly gene-gene co-occurrence network. Out of 33,028
      PMIDs collected initially, the segregation of 24,350 articles under 28 Medical
      Subject Headings (MeSH) was analyzed and plotted. Keyword link network and
      density visualizations were provided for the top 1000 frequent Mesh keywords.
      PubTator was used, and 322,026 bioconcepts were able to extracted under 10
      classes (such as Gene, Disease, CellLine, etc.). Co-occurrence networks were
      constructed for PMID-bioconcept as well as bioconcept-bioconcept associations.
      Further, for creation of subnetwork with respect to gene-gene co-occurrence, a
      total of 11,100 unique genes participated with mTOR and AKT showing the highest
      (64) number of connections. The gene p53 was the most popular one in the network 
      in accordance with both the degree and weighted degree centrality, which were 425
      and 1414, respectively. The present piece of study is an amalgam of bibliometrics

TI  - Application of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in the Evaluation of Nutritional
      Status: A Literature Review with Focus on Dialysis Patients.
LID - 2037 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu13062037 [doi]
AB  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is indispensable in clinical medicine for the
      morphological and tomographic evaluation of many parenchymal organs. With varied 
      imaging methods, diverse biological information, such as the perfusion volume and
      measurements of metabolic products, can be obtained. In addition to conventional 
      MRI for morphological assessment, diffusion-weighted MRI/diffusion tensor imaging
      is used to evaluate white matter structures in the brain; arterial spin labeling 
      is used for cerebral blood flow evaluation; magnetic resonance elastography for
      fatty liver and cirrhosis evaluation; magnetic resonance spectroscopy for
      evaluation of metabolites in specific regions of the brain; and blood oxygenation
      level-dependent imaging for neurological exploration of eating behavior, obesity,
      and food perception. This range of applications will continue to expand in the
      future. Nutritional science is a multidisciplinary and all-inclusive field of
      research; therefore, there are many different applications of MRI. We present a
      literature review of MRI techniques that can be used to evaluate the nutritional 
      status, particularly in patients on dialysis. We used MEDLINE as the information 
      source, conducted a keyword search in PubMed, and found that, as a nutritional
      evaluation method, MRI has been used frequently to comprehensively and
      quantitatively evaluate muscle mass for the determination of body composition.

TI  - Assessing Variation in State Opioid Tapering Laws: Comparing State Laws with the 
      CDC Guideline.
PG  - 2941-2949
LID - 10.1093/pm/pnab208 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In 2016, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention released an
      opioid prescribing guideline for primary care in response to opioid overdose
      deaths. Despite efforts to encourage safer prescribing practices, experts and
      federal agencies suspect prescribing guidelines may be misapplied in clinical
      practice, resulting in abrupt tapering from opioid therapy. Although state laws
      likely influence prescriber behavior, little is known about state tapering laws. 
      Thus, we examined the scope and variation of state tapering laws compared with
      federal opioid guidelines. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive review of state 
      laws through December 31, 2019, using keyword searches in LexisNexus. Identified 
      laws were coded based on the inclusion of attributes derived from federal opioid 
      guidelines and an expert consensus panel report. We examined whether law
      attributes were associated with state characteristics, including region,
      population, governor's political affiliation, opioid prescribing rates, and
      opioid overdose rates. RESULTS: We found 27 states and one federal district had
      law(s) mentioning tapering. Most laws were authored by medical boards or workers'
      compensation groups (65.6%) while some laws included a penalty (32.8%).
      Approximately half of guideline attributes (54.2%) were included in state laws;
      however, only two state's laws cautioned against abrupt tapering. States with
      higher overdose death rates were more likely to enact a tapering law (P < 0.001) 
      and have a penalty (P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: State tapering laws incorporate some
      federal guideline attributes but most lack attributes deemed critical by experts.
      Without clear instruction, patients risk inappropriate tapering and
      discontinuation of opioid therapy. Given these findings, policymakers should
      consider addressing this gap.

TI  - Exposure of second hand smoke in women and children: A narrative review.
PG  - 1804-1807
LID - 10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_1397_20 [doi]
AB  - Second-hand smoke is a neglected public health issue. Every year 1.2 million
      people die due to this exposure. Second-hand smoke is also related to various
      other diseases like cardiovascular diseases, lung diseases, low birth weight,
      maternal depression, etc. The purpose of this review is to look over various
      studies and to gain an understanding of existing research about second-hand smoke
      and its adverse effects. In addition, we tried to identify the barriers behind
      creating a smoke-free environment at home and successful strategies employed and 
      suggestion given in various studies. A comprehensive search of the recent
      literature related to Second-hand smoke was undertaken using electronic databases
      like MEDLINE, PUBMED, Google Scholar, and Research gate. Keyword searches were
      conducted for publications published since 2004 or later on Second-hand smoke
      exposure in pregnant women. Prevalence of SHS among pregnant women ranged from
      24% 92%. Lack of knowledge, absence of comprehensive smoking ban, low status of
      women was among the main contributing factors. Community awareness and counseling
      by primary health-care physician was found to be successful strategies. There are
      various cultural and social barriers behind a smoke-free home for pregnant women.
      Interventional approaches like focused counseling by primary care physicians can 
      help to overcome this issue. There is a need for behavioral interventions and
      community awareness to be done in this aspect.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical and pathopsychological features of youth
      depressions with attenuated schizophrenic symptoms (ASS), and their significance 
      for early differential diagnostic and nosological assessment. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: Twenty young patients (19.7+/-3.7 years) with the first depressive
      episode with attenuated schizophrenic symptoms (ASS) (ICD-10 items F32.1, F32.2, 
      F32.3) (basic group) were divided into subgroup 1 with attenuated positive
      symptoms - APS (19.3%) and subgroup 2 with attenuated negative symptoms - ANS
      (45.1%). Eleven young patients (19.4+/-2.9 years) with the classic depressive
      episode without ASS (ICD-10 items F32.1, F32.2) were included in a control group.
      Psychometric scales HDRS, SOPS, SANS, pathopsychological methods and Adult
      Personality Traits Questionnaire (APTQ) were used. RESULTS: Statistically
      significant differences in the severity of depression were not found. A higher
      SOPS total score (p=0.006) and a greater severity of negative symptoms on SANS
      (p=0.006) were detected in patients of clinical groups compared with the
      comparison group. Distortion of the generalization process was detected in 60% of
      cases, impairments of immediate memorization were found in 30%, and the
      non-constructive nature of associations in 10%. Indirect data on greater
      emotional integrity of patients from the comparison group was obtained.
      CONCLUSION: The presence of similar clinical and psychological abnormalities in
      the youth depressions with ASS allows us to attribute these phenomena to the
      possible risk factors for the development of schizophrenia.

      Internet: A Cross Sectional Analysis.
LID - 10.1097/BRS.0000000000004146 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate
      the quality and accuracy of the content surrounding cervical radiculopathy
      available on the internet. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Those experiencing
      cervical radiculopathy and their families are increasingly browsing the world
      wide web for medical information. As the information offered is likely to
      influence their health care choices, spine care providers must understand the
      quality and accuracy of that information. METHODS: Independent searches were
      conducted on the three most commonly accessed search engines (Google, Yahoo and
      Bing) using the keyword "cervical radiculopathy". The searches were performed on 
      June 28th, 2019. The top 50 sites from each search engines were reviewed. The
      websites were evaluated using quality, accuracy and usability markers. RESULTS:
      77 unique websites were analyzed. 54.5% were physician or medical group
      professional sites, 20.8% as non-physician, 10.4% as unidentified, 7.8% as
      academics and 6.5% were commercial. Accuracy ranged from less than 25% to more
      than 75% were recorded with a mean accuracy of 3.5 signifying 50-75% agreement.
      Overall, website categories had a significant effect on Journal of American
      Medical Association (JAMA) score, content quality, accuracy, total summary
      scores, distraction index, reading ease and grade level (p < 0.05). Academic
      sites had the highest mean quality content, accuracy and total summary scores.
      Four of the top five websites with the highest total summary scores were
      physician driven. On average, Health on the Net code (HONcode) certified websites
      had lower grade level readability with greater reading ease and higher DISCERN
      and JAMA scores than un-certified sites (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the wide
      number of sources available, the quality, accuracy, pertinence and
      intelligibility of the information remains highly variable. Clinicians treating
      patients with cervical radiculopathy should direct them to verifiable sites with 
      regulated information and, where possible, contribute high quality information to
      those sites.Level of Evidence: 4.

AB  - PURPOSE: The Gleason score is an important grading factor of prostate cancer.
      Gleason scores can be extracted from pathology report texts using regular
      expressions, but previously developed programmes have targeted only relatively
      simple Gleason score expressions. We developed a programme capable of extracting 
      also complex expressions. The programme is relatively easy to adapt to other
      languages and datasets. METHODS: We developed and evaluated our regular
      expression-based programme using manually processed pathology reports of prostate
      cancer cases diagnosed in Finland in 2016-2017. Both simple and complex Gleason
      score expressions were targeted. We measured the performance of our programme
      using recall, precision, and the F1. The proportion of complex Gleason score
      expressions was estimated as the complement of the recall when only addition
      expressions (e.g. "Gleason 3 + 4") were targeted. RESULTS: The detection of
      values (scores and score components) is based on mandatory keywords before or
      after the value. The programme favours precision over recall by primarily
      allowing for lists of optional expressions between keyword-value pairs and only
      secondarily allowing for arbitrary expressions. The programme is straightforward 
      to adapt to new datasets by modifying the lists of mandatory and optional
      expressions. The full and addition-only programmes had 92% (95% CI: [90%, 95%])
      and 65% ([61%, 70%]) recall and high precision (98% [97%, 99%] and 100% [99%,
      100%]), respectively. The estimated proportion of complex Gleason score
      expressions was 100-65 = 35%. CONCLUSIONS: Even complex Gleason score expressions
      can be extracted with high recall and precision using regular expressions. We
      recommend implementing automated Gleason score extraction where possible by
      adapting our validated programme.

TI  - Occupational Health Could be the New Normal Challenge in the Trade and Health
      Cycle: Keywords Analysis Between 1990 and 2020.
PG  - 272-276
LID - 10.1016/j.shaw.2020.11.003 [doi]
AB  - This brief report aims to establish the keyword content of studies on
      occupational health and safety-the key framework of the world of work in the
      trade and health domain. Data were collected from the SCOPUS database, focusing
      on articles on occupational health and safety and related keywords, with an
      emphasis on abstracts and titles. Data were analyzed and summarized based on
      keywords included from the MeSH database. There were 24,499 manuscripts in the
      domain and 1,346 (5.40%) occupational health-related keywords, including those
      that overlapped. The most frequently referenced occupational health-related
      keyword was "occupational health" (452 articles), followed by "occupational
      safety" (141 articles). There were fewer keywords on occupational health in the
      trade and health literature. As the world of work has been prioritized because of
      the recent new normal of work life since the COVID-19 pandemic, examining the
      focus of occupational health priorities within the global perspective is crucial.

TI  - Factors to improve distress and fatigue in Cancer survivorship; further
      understanding through text analysis of interviews by machine learning.
PG  - 741
LID - 10.1186/s12885-021-08438-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: From patient-reported surveys and individual interviews by health
      care providers, we attempted to identify the significant factors related to the
      improvement of distress and fatigue for cancer survivors by text analysis with
      machine learning techniques, as the secondary analysis using the single institute
      data from the Korean Cancer Survivorship Center Pilot Project. METHODS: Surveys
      and in-depth interviews from 322 cancer survivors were analyzed to identify their
      needs and concerns. Among the keywords in the surveys, including EQ-VAS,
      distress, fatigue, pain, insomnia, anxiety, and depression, distress and fatigue 
      were focused. The interview transcripts were analyzed via Korean-based text
      analysis with machine learning techniques, based on the keywords used in the
      survey. Words were generated as vectors and similarity scores were calculated by 
      the distance related to the text's keywords and frequency. The keywords and
      selected high-ranked ten words for each keyword based on the similarity were then
      taken to draw a network map. RESULTS: Most participants were otherwise healthy
      females younger than 50 years suffering breast cancer who completed treatment
      less than 6 months ago. As the 1-month follow-up survey's results, the improved
      patients were 56.5 and 58.4% in distress and fatigue scores, respectively. For
      the improvement of distress, dyspepsia (p = 0.006) and initial scores of
      distress, fatigue, anxiety, and depression (p < 0.001, < 0.001, 0.043, and 0.013,
      respectively) were significantly related. For the improvement of fatigue,
      economic state (p = 0.021), needs for rehabilitation (p = 0.035), initial score
      of fatigue (p < 0.001), any intervention (p = 0.017), and participation in family
      care program (p = 0.022) were significant. For the text analysis, Stress and
      Fatigue were placed at the center of the keyword network map, and words were
      intricately connected. From the regression anlysis combined survey scores and the
      quantitative variables from the text analysis, participation in family care
      programs and mention of family-related words were associated with the fatigue
      improvement (p = 0.033). CONCLUSION: Common symptoms and practical issues were
      related to distress and fatigue in the survey. Through text analysis, however, we
      realized that the specific issues and their relationship such as family problem
      were more complicated. Although further research needs to explore the hidden
      problem in cancer patients, this study was meaningful to use personalized
      approach such as interviews.

TI  - Inconsistent Use of Resistance Exercise Names in Research Articles: A Brief Note.
PG  - 3518-3520
LID - 10.1519/JSC.0000000000004083 [doi]
AB  - ABSTRACT: Nuzzo, JL. Inconsistent use of resistance exercise names in research
      articles: a brief note. J Strength Cond Res 35(12): 3518-3520, 2021-Academic
      fields require standard nomenclature to communicate concepts effectively.
      Previous research has documented resistance training exercises are named
      inconsistently. This inconsistent use has been observed among fitness
      professionals and within resistance training textbooks. The purpose of the
      current note was to explore inconsistent use of resistance training exercise
      names in scientific articles. Keyword searches were performed in PubMed to
      identify articles that referred to 4 different resistance training exercises. The
      search was limited to titles and abstracts of articles published between 1960 and
      2020. For exercise 1, "shoulder press," "overhead press," and "military press"
      were searched. For exercise 2, "arm curl," "bicep curl," and "biceps curl" were
      searched. For exercise 3, "hamstring curl," "leg curl," and "knee curl" were
      searched. For exercise 4, "calf raise" and "heel raise" were searched. For
      exercise 1, 114 articles included "shoulder press" in their title or abstract, 42
      articles included "overhead press," and 45 articles included "military press."
      For exercise 2, 244 articles included "arm curl," 37 articles included "bicep
      curl," and 177 articles included "biceps curl." For exercise 3, 24 articles
      included "hamstring curl," 159 articles included "leg curl," and 7 articles
      included "knee curl." For exercise 4, 68 articles included "calf raise" and 154
      articles included "heel raise." The results are evidence of inconsistent use of
      resistance training exercise names in scientific articles. A possible solution to
      inconsistent use of exercise names in research articles, educational texts, and
      clinical practice is a system that includes a standard exercise naming pattern
      and guidelines for communicating exercise names.

TI  - Factors Influencing Paternal Postpartum Depression: A Systematic Review and
      Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 51-63
LID - S0165-0327(21)00532-2 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jad.2021.05.088 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postpartum period is a critical time that requires adjustments not
      only for mothers but also for fathers and may pose risk for depression. Studies
      show that the prevalence of paternal postpartum depression (PPD) is between 1.2% 
      and 25.5%. PPD is an under-recognized public health issue and its reported
      influencing factors are still inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper 
      is to extend the literature by examining influencing factors that affect paternal
      PPD and describe the strength their associations. METHODS: We conducted keyword
      search of Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library and PsycARTICLES
      electronic databases up to Jan 17, 2020, without language restrictions, for
      observational studies investigating the factors influencing paternal PPD and its 
      effects. Fixed or random effect model was used to pool odds ratio (OR) and 95%
      confidence intervals (CI) with Stata software 12.0. Heterogeneity between studies
      was evaluated using Cochran's chi-squared test (Cochran's Q) and I(2) values.
      RESULTS: Nineteen cross-sectional studies and eighteen cohort studies published
      from 1996 to 2019 were included in this review and seventeen studies in the
      meta-analysis. Factors affecting paternal PPD can be classified into paternal,
      maternal, infant and family factors. In Meta-analysis, 9 of 17 influencing
      factors were revealed to be statistically significant: 1) paternal factors:
      unemployment OR= 2.59 (95%CI:1.42-4.74), low social support OR=1.05
      (95%CI:1.03-1.08), negative life events OR=1.45 (95%CI:1.13-1.87), perceived
      stress OR=1.08 (95%CI:1.03-1.12), financial strain OR=2.07 (95%CI:1.13-3.81),
      history of mental illness OR=3.48 (95%CI:2.49-4.86); 2) maternal factors: parity 
      OR=1.36 (95%CI:1.13-1.65) and maternal postnatal depression OR=1.17
      (95%CI:1.03-1.33); 3) family factors: low marital satisfaction OR=1.40
      (95%CI:1.22-1.61). No statistically significant association with infant factors
      was found in the meta-analysis. LIMITATIONS: There was publication bias since we 
      only included English studies. Samples were under-represented in low-and
      middle-income countries. The meta-analysis results are subject to unobserved
      confounding factors and cannot explain causality. CONCLUSION: This overview of
      the evidence suggests a relationship between paternal employment, psychological
      status, history of maternal mental illness, first pregnancy, marital relationship
      and paternal PPD. The low number of studies for some infant factors in
      meta-analysis leaves gaps in knowledge that need to be addressed. The mechanisms 
      underlying the reported associations and their causal relationship still remain
      unclear. The awareness of the serious long-term consequences of paternal PPD
      should encourage better identification of those at risk and the development of
      effective interventions to protect fathers from PPD.

      analysis and visualization.
PG  - 24
LID - 10.47176/mjiri.35.24 [doi]
AB  - Background: COVID-19 pandemic crisis motivated researchers worldwide to deeply
      investigate it from different perspectives. As Iran is one of the highly-affected
      countries by Covid-19, Iranian researchers have focused on studying it. This
      study aimed at analyzing and visualizing Iranian researchers' papers on COVID-19 
      from a bibliometric perspective. Methods: By searching MeSH-selected keywords
      related to COVID-19 in Scopus, Iranian researchers' papers on COVID-19 were
      extracted in a CSV format and underwent bibliometric techniques, such as
      coauthorship analysis, citation, and co-citation analysis, keyword and term
      co-occurrence mapping and etc. in the Microsoft Excel and VOSviewer software
      package. Results: A total of 405 papers were authored by Iranian researchers on
      COVID-19 during the study period, with the average number of citations per paper 
      of 2.60 and a mean h-index of 15. The majority of papers were original articles
      in English. Archives of Clinical Infectious Diseases and Archives of Iranian
      Medicine and Medical Hypotheses were highly ranked publishing journals,
      respectively. The most productive institute and author were Tehran University of 
      Medical Sciences with 119 papers and Rezaei, N. with 12 papers. Iranian
      researchers collaborated with the researchers of 73 countries, with the USA
      ranking first in Covid-19 research, followed by Italy, Canada, and United
      Kingdom. In publishing papers on COVID-19, Iran ranked first among the Middle

TI  - Evolution of Telepsychiatry: Scientometric Analysis of Telepsychiatry
      Publications Between 1986 and 2019.
LID - 10.1089/tmj.2021.0044 [doi]
AB  - Background: Although telepsychiatry has a long history, medical literature lacks 
      a scientometric study evaluating telepsychiatry publications. The purpose of this
      study was to perform a holistic analysis of telepsychiatry articles published
      between 1986 and 2019. Methods: We used the "telepsychiatry" keyword for our
      search and included all documents indexed in Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics,
      USA) Core Collection between 1986 and 2019, revealing a total of 1,020 articles, 
      of which only 224 were open access. Results: The peak year for publication was
      2015, with 96 articles. The United States ranked first with 601 documents
      followed by Australia and Canada. The University of California and University of 
      Washington were the most productive institutions and, again, 8 of the 10 leading 
      institutions were from the United States. The peak year for citations was 2019,
      with a total of 2,080 records. Discussion: We believe that systematic approaches 
      are needed to reveal the positive and negative features of telepsychiatry
      practice, especially from countries where this method is widely utilized, to
      elucidate the need for telepsychiatry in other countries/regions and to determine
      how its use can be increased in regions with limited access to health care
      workers. Conclusion: Although scientific interest in telepsychiatry appears to
      have increased almost every year since 1986, it has been observed that this
      interest is still concentrated in certain countries, such as the United States,
      Australia, and Canada, indicating that telepsychiatry may not have gained use in 
      other countries.

PG  - 1505-1509
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim: To analyze the challenges and approaches used in medical
      universities in different countries during the transfer of training from offline 
      to online format during the COVID-19 pandemic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials
      and methods: Electronic databases of Scielo, Scopus and PubMed were searched
      using keyword searches. CONCLUSION: Conclusions: The use of a large number of
      online tools and ICTs to develop the clinical skills of medical students has
      become a real pedagogical breakthrough in medical education. Innovations and
      technological efficiency of educational tools will change medical education
      forever. But it is difficult to give an unambiguous assessment of the delayed
      effects of these changes, since not much is yet known about the long-term impact 
      of COVID-19 on the medical education.

PG  - 104-113
LID - 10.17116/neiro202185031104 [doi]
AB  - Cavernous malformations (CMs) of central nervous system are vascular
      malformations usually localized in the brain and rarely in the spinal cord. To
      date, these malformations are well studied. However, some problems of the
      management of this pathology are still unresolved. This is due to rare
      localization of intramedullary CMs in the spinal cord and difficult treatment of 
      spinal pathology per se. To date, about 1000 cases of spinal CM are described in 
      the literature. This review is devoted to natural course of disease and
      postoperative outcomes. These data allow getting a complete picture of modern
      concepts of the treatment of spinal CMs and formulating the questions requiring
      further discussion.

      review.
PG  - 183
LID - 10.1186/s13643-021-01707-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Cancer research on sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations is
      gaining momentum. The purpose of this systematic review was to examine what is
      currently known in the research literature regarding patient-reported health
      outcomes after cancer treatment among SGM populations. METHODS: In March 2021, a 
      medical librarian conducted a systematic keyword search on PubMed, Embase,
      Scopus, Web of Science, PsycINFO, ClinicalTrials.gov , and the Cochrane Central
      Register of Controlled Trials. The primary inclusion criterion was assessment of 
      at least one physical, psychosocial, emotional, or functional patient-reported
      health outcome related to the impacts of cancer diagnosis and/or treatment.
      Articles that met inclusion criteria were reviewed in their entirety, charted in 
      a Word Table, and assessed for quality. Quality considerations included study
      design, sampling approach, diversity of sample, measures used, and analytic
      procedures. Studies were synthesized based on type of cancer study participants
      experienced. RESULTS: Sixty-four studies were included in the final analysis:
      most were quantitative, secondary analyses or cross-sectional studies with
      convenience samples, and focused on people with a history of breast or prostate
      cancer. Differences between sexual minority men and women in terms of coping and 
      resilience were noted. Few studies reported on experiences of transgender persons
      and none reported on experiences of intersex persons. CONCLUSIONS: A growing
      literature describes the patient-reported health outcomes of SGM people with a
      history of cancer. This study summarizes important between-group differences
      among SGM and heterosexual, cisgender counterparts that are critical for
      clinicians to consider when providing care. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS:
      Sexual orientation and gender identity are relevant to cancer survivors' health
      outcomes. Subgroups of SGM people have differential experiences and outcomes
      related to cancer and its impacts.

TI  - Social Media Insights During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Infodemiology Study Using Big
      Data.
PG  - e27116
LID - 10.2196/27116 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is still undergoing complicated developments in
      Vietnam and around the world. There is a lot of information about the COVID-19
      pandemic, especially on the internet where people can create and share
      information quickly. This can lead to an infodemic, which is a challenge every
      government might face in the fight against pandemics. OBJECTIVE: This study aims 
      to understand public attention toward the pandemic (from December 2019 to
      November 2020) through 7 types of sources: Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, blogs,
      news sites, forums, and e-commerce sites. METHODS: We collected and analyzed
      nearly 38 million pieces of text data from the aforementioned sources via
      SocialHeat, a social listening (infoveillance) platform developed by YouNet
      Group. We described not only public attention volume trends, discussion
      sentiments, top sources, top posts that gained the most public attention, and hot
      keyword frequency but also hot keywords' co-occurrence as visualized by the
      VOSviewer software tool. RESULTS: In this study, we reached four main
      conclusions. First, based on changing discussion trends regarding the COVID-19
      subject, 7 periods were identified based on events that can be aggregated into
      two pandemic waves in Vietnam. Second, community pages on Facebook were the
      source of the most engagement from the public. However, the sources with the
      highest average interaction efficiency per article were government sources.
      Third, people's attitudes when discussing the pandemic have changed from negative
      to positive emotions. Fourth, the type of content that attracts the most
      interactions from people varies from time to time. Besides that, the
      issue-attention cycle theory occurred not only once but four times during the
      COVID-19 pandemic in Vietnam. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that online resources 
      can help the government quickly identify public attention to public health
      messages during times of crisis. We also determined the hot spots that most
      interested the public and public attention communication patterns, which can help
      the government get practical information to make more effective policy reactions 
      to help prevent the spread of the pandemic.

TI  - Mapping the knowledge domain of the evolution of emergy theory: a bibliometric
      approach.
PG  - 43114-43142
LID - 10.1007/s11356-021-14959-3 [doi]
AB  - Bibliometric and visualization tools are effective for uncovering information
      contained in vast amounts of literature data. We retrieved publications from the 
      Web of Science (2008-2020) and used the Statistical Analysis Toolkit for
      Informetrics (SATI) and CiteSpace to conduct a bibliometric analysis of emergy
      studies, review the focus of the studies, summarize current research, and
      identify academic trends. The SATI-based charts provided an overall description
      of yearly published articles, literature sources, high-frequency keywords,
      authors, institutions, and highly cited papers. CiteSpace was applied to
      determine the frontiers and hotspots of emergy theory. A dual-map analysis was
      used to reveal the connection between multiple disciplines. Keyword clustering
      analysis was performed to evaluate research hotspots. Moreover, burst analysis
      and timeline maps presented a holistic picture of cutting-edge issues and the
      evolutionary trajectory of emergy studies in recent years. An alluvial flow map
      analysis of the landmark literature depicted the transmission of knowledge in the
      emergy field. In addition, this article also evaluated the current status of
      collaborative research in emergy-related fields. The results can provide a
      reference for researchers to explore hot issues or target a specific field of
      study.

TI  - Benefits, challenges, and contributors to success for national eHealth systems
      implementation: a scoping review.
PG  - 2039-2049
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocab096 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our scoping review aims to assess what legal, ethical, and
      socio-technical factors contribute to or inhibit the success of national eHealth 
      system implementations. In addition, our review seeks to describe the
      characteristics and benefits of eHealth systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We
      conducted a scoping review of literature published in English between January
      2000 and 2020 using a keyword search on 5 databases: PubMed, Scopus, Web of
      Science, IEEEXplore, and ProQuest. After removal of duplicates, abstract
      screening, and full-text filtering, 86 articles were included from 8276 search
      results. RESULTS: We identified 17 stakeholder groups, 6 eHealth Systems areas,
      and 15 types of legal regimes and standards. In-depth textual analysis revealed
      challenges mainly in implementation, followed by ethico-legal and data-related
      aspects. Key factors influencing success include promoting trust of the system,
      ensuring wider acceptance among users, reconciling the system with legal
      requirements, and ensuring an adaptable technical platform. DISCUSSION: Results
      revealed support for decentralized implementations because they carry less
      implementation and engagement challenges than centralized ones. Simultaneously,
      due to decentralized systems' interoperability issues, federated implementations 
      (with a set of national standards) might be preferable. CONCLUSION: This study
      identifies the primary socio-technical, legal, and ethical factors that challenge
      and contribute to the success of eHealth system implementations. This study also 
      describes the complexities and characteristics of existing eHealth implementation
      programs, and suggests guidance for resolving the identified challenges.

      applications.
PG  - 975-987
LID - 10.1080/14760584.2021.1945449 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Heat-labile enterotoxins (HLTs) and their cognate ganglioside
      receptors have been extensively studied because of their therapeutic potential.
      Gangliosides play arole in modulating effector cells of the immune system, and
      HLTs provide a novel means for stimulating ganglioside-mediated responses in
      immunocompetent cells.Areas covered: To evaluate the mechanisms of HLT
      adjuvanticity, a systemic literature review was performed using relevant keyword 
      searches of the PubMed database, accessing literature published as recently as
      late 2020. Since HLTs bind to specific ganglioside receptors on immunocytes, they
      can act as regulators via stimulation or tapering of immune responses from
      associated signal transduction events. Binding of HLTs to gangliosides can
      increase proliferation of T-cells, increase cytokine release, augment
      mucosal/systemic antibody responses, and increase the effectiveness of antigen
      presenting cells. Subunit components also independently stimulate certain immune 
      responses. Mutant forms of HLTs have potent immunomodulatory effects without the 
      toxicity associated with holotoxins.Expert opinion: HLTs have been the subject of
      abundant research exploring their use as vaccine adjuvants, in the treatment of
      autoimmune conditions, in cancer therapy, and for weight loss, proving that these
      molecules are promising tools in the field of immunotherapy.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Substandard medicines are medicines that fail to meet their quality
      standards and/or specifications. Substandard medicines can lead to serious safety
      issues affecting public health. With the increasing number of pharmaceuticals and
      the complexity of the pharmaceutical manufacturing supply chain, monitoring for
      substandard medicines via manual environmental scanning can be laborious and time
      consuming. METHODS: A web crawler was developed to automatically detect and
      extract alerts on substandard medicines published on the Internet by regulatory
      agencies. The crawled data were labelled as related to substandard medicines or
      not. An expert-derived keyword-based classification algorithm was compared
      against machine learning algorithms to identify substandard medicine alerts on
      two validation datasets (n = 4920 and n = 2458) from a later time period than
      training data. Models were comparatively assessed for recall, precision and their
      F1 scores (harmonic mean of precision and recall). RESULTS: The web crawler
      routinely extracted alerts from the 46 web pages belonging to nine regulatory
      agencies. From October 2019 to May 2020, 12,156 unique alerts were crawled of
      which 7378 (60.7%) alerts were set aside for validation and contained 1160
      substandard medicine alerts (15.7%). An ensemble approach of combining machine
      learning and keywords achieved the best recall (94% and 97%), precision (85% and 
      80%) and F1 scores (89% and 88%) on temporal validation. CONCLUSIONS: Combining
      robust web crawler programmes with rigorously tested filtering algorithms based
      on machine learning and keyword models can automate and expand horizon scanning
      capabilities for issues relating to substandard medicines.

AB  - CONTEXT: Interest in implementing palliative care for adults living with
      progressive central nervous system diseases (PCNSD) and their caregivers is
      increasing. OBJECTIVES: To inform evidence-based practice and future research by 
      critically evaluating randomized clinical trials (RCTs) investigating palliative 
      care interventions (PCIs) for adults living with PCNSD and their caregivers using
      self-reported outcomes and the patient- and caregiver-reported outcome measures
      employed. METHODS: A systematic search using PRISMA methods of EMBASE, PubMed,
      Scopus, Web of Science databases using index and keyword methods for articles
      published from inception through February 28, 2021 was performed. RCTs
      investigating PCI as their primary aim using patient- and/or caregiver-reported
      outcomes to assess PCI effectiveness in adults living with PCNSD and their
      caregivers were included for qualitative synthesis. RESULTS: Five RCTs met
      criteria and used 21 unique outcome measures. Pooled patient diagnoses included
      multiple sclerosis, motor neuron disease and movement disorders, primarily
      Parkinson's Disease. All five RCTs assessed PCI effectiveness on patient symptom 
      burden and caregiver burden, and three RCTs used patient QOL as a primary
      outcome. Overall risk of bias was low. Pooled positive findings were limited to
      very modest changes in patient QOL, specific physical symptoms and caregiver
      burden. Most outcome measures lacked clinimetric responsiveness to detect change 
      whether caused by disease or an intervention to the patient or caregiver.
      CONCLUSION: Sparse, low-certainty evidence for PCI impact on patient QOL, symptom
      burden and caregiver burden indicate future research should consider refining
      study populations, interventions, outcomes assessed and outcome measures to
      detect any change due to PCI.

TI  - Public Discussion of Anthrax on Twitter: Using Machine Learning to Identify
      Relevant Topics and Events.
PG  - e27976
LID - 10.2196/27976 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Social media allows researchers to study opinions and reactions to
      events in real time. One area needing more study is anthrax-related events. A
      computational framework that utilizes machine learning techniques was created to 
      collect tweets discussing anthrax, further categorize them as relevant by the
      month of data collection, and detect discussions on anthrax-related events.
      OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to detect discussions on
      anthrax-related events and to determine the relevance of the tweets and topics of
      discussion over 12 months of data collection. METHODS: This is an infoveillance
      study, using tweets in English containing the keyword "Anthrax" and "Bacillus
      anthracis", collected from September 25, 2017, through August 15, 2018. Machine
      learning techniques were used to determine what people were tweeting about
      anthrax. Data over time was plotted to determine whether an event was detected (a
      3-fold spike in tweets). A machine learning classifier was created to categorize 
      tweets by relevance to anthrax. Relevant tweets by month were examined using a
      topic modeling approach to determine the topics of discussion over time and how
      these events influence that discussion. RESULTS: Over the 12 months of data
      collection, a total of 204,008 tweets were collected. Logistic regression
      analysis revealed the best performance for relevance (precision=0.81;
      recall=0.81; F1-score=0.80). In total, 26 topics were associated with
      anthrax-related events, tweets that were highly retweeted, natural outbreaks, and
      news stories. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that tweets related to anthrax can be
      collected and analyzed over time to determine what people are discussing and to
      detect key anthrax-related events. Future studies are required to focus only on
      opinion tweets, use the methodology to study other terrorism events, or to
      monitor for terrorism threats.

TI  - Body dysmorphic disorder and self-esteem: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 310
LID - 10.1186/s12888-021-03185-3 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is associated with low self-esteem. The
      aim of this meta-analysis was to examine the strength of the cross-sectional
      relationship between BDD symptom severity and global self-esteem in individuals
      with BDD, mentally healthy controls, community or student samples, and cosmetic
      surgery patients. Moreover, the role of depressive symptom severity in this
      relationship and other moderating factors were investigated. METHODS: A
      keyword-based literature search was performed to identify studies in which BDD
      symptoms and global self-esteem were assessed. Random effects meta-analysis of
      Fisher's z-transformed correlations and partial correlations controlling for the 
      influence of depressive symptom severity was conducted. In addition to
      meta-analysis of the observed effects, we corrected the individual correlations
      for variance restrictions to address varying ranges of BDD symptom severity
      across samples. RESULTS: Twenty-five studies with a total of 6278 participants
      were included. A moderately negative relationship between BDD symptom severity
      and global self-esteem was found (r = -.42, CI = [-.48, -.35] for uncorrected
      correlations, r = -.45, CI = [-.51, -.39] for artifact-corrected correlations). A
      meta-analysis of partial correlations revealed that depressive symptom severity
      could partly account for the aforementioned relationship (pr = -.20, CI = [-.25, 
      -.15] for uncorrected partial correlations, pr = -.23, CI = [-.28, -.17] for
      artifact-corrected partial correlations). The sample type (e.g., individuals with
      BDD, mentally healthy controls, or community samples) and diagnosis of BDD
      appeared to moderate the relationship only before artifact correction of effect
      sizes, whereas all moderators were non-significant in the meta-analysis of
      artifact-corrected correlations. CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrate that low
      self-esteem is an important hallmark of BDD beyond the influence of depressive
      symptoms. It appears that negative evaluation in BDD is not limited to appearance
      but also extends to other domains of the self. Altogether, our findings emphasize
      the importance of addressing self-esteem and corresponding core beliefs in
      prevention and treatment of BDD.

TI  - Sodium azide poisoning: a narrative review.
PG  - 683-697
LID - 10.1080/15563650.2021.1906888 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Sodium azide is a highly toxic chemical. Its production has increased
      dramatically over the last 30 years due to its widespread use in vehicular
      airbags, and it is available for purchase online. Thus, accidental exposure to
      azide or use as a homicidal or suicidal agent could be on the rise, and secondary
      exposure to medical personnel can occur. No antidote exists for azide poisoning. 
      We conducted a systematic review of azide poisoning to assess recent poisoning
      reports, exposure scenarios, clinical presentations, and treatment strategies.
      METHODS: We searched both medical and newspaper databases to review the
      literature between 01/01/2000 and 12/31/2020, pairing the controlled vocabulary
      and keyword terms "sodium azide" or "hydrazoic acid" with terms relating to
      exposures and outcomes, such as "ingestion," "inhalation," "exposure,"
      "poisoning," and "death." We included all peer-reviewed papers and news articles 
      describing human azide poisoning cases from English and non-English publications 
      that could be identified using English keywords. Data abstracted included the
      number, age, and gender of cases, mode of exposure, exposure setting, azide dose 
      and route of exposure, symptoms, outcome, and treatment modalities. RESULTS: We
      identified 663 peer-reviewed papers and 303 newspaper articles. After removing
      duplicated and non-qualifying sources, 54 publications were reviewed describing
      156 cases, yielding an average of 7.8 reported azide poisoning cases per year.
      This rate is three times higher than in a previous review covering the period of 
      1927 to 1999. Poisoning occurred most commonly in laboratory workers, during
      secondary exposure of medical personnel, or from a ripped airbag. Hypotension
      occurred commonly, in some cases requiring vasopressors and one patient received 
      an intra-aortic ballon pump. Gastric lavage and/or activated charcoal were used
      for oral azide ingestion, and sodium nitrite, sodium thiosulfate, and/or
      hydroxocobalamin were used in severely poisoned patients. CONCLUSIONS: Recent
      increases in azide poisoning reports may stem from greater commercial use and
      availability. Treatment of systemic poisoning may require aggressive hemodynamic 
      support due to profound hypotension. Based on mechanistic considerations,
      hydroxocobalamin is a rational choice for treating azide poisoning.

AB  - The aim of this article is to assess the use of the term Social Economy, while
      being aware of its lack of concreteness, and to analyze the level of scientific
      production by means of a bibliometric analysis using WoS (JCR) and Scopus (SJR)
      as sources. Starting in 2004 and related to the Charter of Principles of the
      Social Economy, the material development of articles began. The most receptive
      countries are Spain, the USA, China, the UK and Canada. In terms of the most
      productive journals, Voluntas in JCR and CIRIEC-Spain and REVESCO in SJR stand
      out. Scientific production on this issue is linked to university institutions,
      namely the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the University of Valencia and the
      University of Quebec. The most prevalent subject are Economics and Business in
      the case of JCR and Social Sciences in SJR. The most recognized term is that of
      cooperatives and the most prevalent keyword trends being related to sustainable
      development, climate change, urbanization, management and China.

TI  - A Determinants-of-Fertility Ontology for Detecting Future Signals of Fertility
      Issues From Social Media Data: Development of an Ontology.
PG  - e25028
LID - 10.2196/25028 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: South Korea has the lowest fertility rate in the world despite
      considerable governmental efforts to boost it. Increasing the fertility rate and 
      achieving the desired outcomes of any implemented policies requires reliable data
      on the ongoing trends in fertility and preparations for the future based on these
      trends. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to (1) develop a
      determinants-of-fertility ontology with terminology for collecting and analyzing 
      social media data; (2) determine the description logics, content coverage, and
      structural and representational layers of the ontology; and (3) use the ontology 
      to detect future signals of fertility issues. METHODS: An ontology was developed 
      using the Ontology Development 101 methodology. The domain and scope of the
      ontology were defined by compiling a list of competency questions. The terms were
      collected from Korean government reports, Korea's Basic Plan for Low Fertility
      and Aging Society, a national survey about marriage and childbirth, and social
      media postings on fertility issues. The classes and their hierarchy were defined 
      using a top-down approach based on an ecological model. The internal structure of
      classes was defined using the entity-attribute-value model. The description
      logics of the ontology were evaluated using Protege (version 5.5.0), and the
      content coverage was evaluated by comparing concepts extracted from social media 
      posts with the list of ontology classes. The structural and representational
      layers of the ontology were evaluated by experts. Social media data were
      collected from 183 online channels between January 1, 2011, and June 30, 2015. To
      detect future signals of fertility issues, 2 classes of the ontology, the
      socioeconomic and cultural environment, and public policy, were identified as
      keywords. A keyword issue map was constructed, and the defined keywords were
      mapped to identify future signals. R software (version 3.5.2) was used to mine
      for future signals. RESULTS: A determinants-of-fertility ontology comprised 236
      classes and terminology comprised 1464 synonyms of the 236 classes. Concept
      classes in the ontology were found to be coherently and consistently defined. The
      ontology included more than 90% of the concepts that appeared in social media
      posts on fertility policies. Average scores for all of the criteria for
      structural and representations layers exceeded 4 on a 5-point scale. Violence and
      abuse (socioeconomic and cultural factor) and flexible working arrangement
      (fertility policy) were weak signals, suggesting that they could increase rapidly
      in the future. CONCLUSIONS: The determinants-of-fertility ontology developed in
      this study can be used as a framework for collecting and analyzing social media
      data on fertility issues and detecting future signals of fertility issues. The
      future signals identified in this study will be useful for policy makers who are 
      developing policy responses to low fertility.

TI  - A quality assessment of YouTube content on shoulder instability.
PG  - 1-6
LID - 10.1080/00913847.2021.1942286 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Internet is a widely used resource for patients seeking health
      information, yet little editing or regulations are imposed on posted material. We
      sought to assess the quality and accuracy of information presented on shoulder
      instability on the online video platform YouTube. We hypothesize that YouTube
      videos concerning shoulder instability will be of little quality, accuracy, and
      reliability. METHODS: The first 50 YouTube videos resulting from the keyword
      query 'shoulder instability' were analyzed. The Journal of American Medical
      Association (JAMA) benchmark criteria (score range, 0-4) was used to assess video
      accuracy and reliability, and the Global Quality Score (GQS; score range, 0-5)
      was used to assess the quality of the video's educational content along with a
      generated Shoulder-Specific Score (SSS). RESULTS: The 50 videos observed
      collectively had 5,007,486 views, with the mean number of views being 100,149.72 
      +/- 227,218.04. Of all videos observed, 32% were from a medical source and 56%
      had content relating to pathology information. The mean JAMA score was 2.84 +/-
      0.74, with the highest scores coming from academic sources. The mean GQS and SSS 
      scores were 2.68 +/- 0.84 and 5.30 +/- 3.78. The mean GQS score was highest in
      videos from medical sources (3.3 +/- 0.8) and videos about surgical
      technique/approach (3.2 +/- 1.1). Advertisements were negative predictors of the 
      JAMA score (beta = -0.324, P = 0.014), and academic (beta = 0.322, P = 0.015) and
      physician sources (beta = 0.356, P = 0.008) were positive predictors. CONCLUSION:
      YouTube videos on shoulder instability are of low quality and accuracy and are
      not reliable. Care providers should be aware of the overall low quality of
      information available on YouTube regarding shoulder instability.

AB  - Glioma is the most common primary intraparenchymal tumor of the brain and the
      5-year survival rate of high-grade glioma is poor. Magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) is essential for detecting, characterizing and monitoring brain tumors but 
      definitive diagnosis still relies on surgical pathology. Machine learning has
      been applied to the analysis of MRI data in glioma research and has the potential
      to change clinical practice and improve patient outcomes. This systematic review 
      synthesizes and analyzes the current state of machine learning applications to
      glioma MRI data and explores the use of machine learning for systematic review
      automation. Various datapoints were extracted from the 153 studies that met
      inclusion criteria and analyzed. Natural language processing (NLP) analysis
      involved keyword extraction, topic modeling and document classification. Machine 
      learning has been applied to tumor grading and diagnosis, tumor segmentation,
      non-invasive genomic biomarker identification, detection of progression and
      patient survival prediction. Model performance was generally strong (AUC = 0.87
      +/- 0.09; sensitivity = 0.87 +/- 0.10; specificity = 0.0.86 +/- 0.10; precision =
      0.88 +/- 0.11). Convolutional neural network, support vector machine and random
      forest algorithms were top performers. Deep learning document classifiers yielded
      acceptable performance (mean 5-fold cross-validation AUC = 0.71). Machine
      learning tools and data resources were synthesized and summarized to facilitate
      future research. Machine learning has been widely applied to the processing of
      MRI data in glioma research and has demonstrated substantial utility. NLP and
      transfer learning resources enabled the successful development of a replicable
      method for automating the systematic review article screening process, which has 
      potential for shortening the time from discovery to clinical application in
      medicine.

TI  - [Modern Treatment Options for Postoperative Chylothorax: a Systematic Review].
PG  - 439-446
LID - 10.1055/a-1172-7288 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chylothorax is a multifactorial complication, usually caused by
      surgery or traumatic injury, and more rarely by malignant disease. Because of the
      lack of prospective, randomised trials, the evidence-based treatment rests upon
      personal experience, but ideally taking into account retrospective analysis.
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive
      overview of the currently available modern treatment options. Another aspect is
      to show their advantages and disadvantages. For this purpose, a literature search
      was performed using the "PubMed" database. Publications older than ten years were
      excluded from this review. The literature search employed the keyword
      "chylothorax". The priority was set on publications including a comparative
      assessment of treatment approaches. The authors relied on many years of clinical 
      experience to critically analyse and evaluate the treatment options and the given
      recommendations. RESULTS: The success rate of the conservative treatment methods 
      ranges widely, depending on the underlying cause of the disease (3-90 %).
      Non-invasive or semi-invasive procedures are successful in 50 to 100 % of the
      cases, also depending on the aetiology. After unsuccessful conservative treatment
      of operable patients, the standard surgical therapy consists of thoracic duct
      ligature, which is usually performed thoracoscopically. Alternatively,
      pleurodesis or the placement of a permanent chest drain (PleurX) or a
      pleuroperitoneal shunt may be performed. The success rate of these procedures is 
      between 64 and 100 %. The morbidity and mortality rate can reach values up to 25 
      %. CONCLUSION: Treatment of a chylothorax should be started conservatively.
      Subsequently, a more aggressive therapy may be gradually considered, based on the
      patient's health and the amount of the secretion. Interventional radiological
      procedures are safe, successful, and have a legitimate place alongside
      conservative or surgical treatment. However, they are currently only available in
      some larger centres.

TI  - Which traumatic spinal injury creates which degree of instability? A systematic
      quantitative review.
PG  - 136-156
LID - S1529-9430(21)00725-7 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.spinee.2021.06.004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Traumatic spinal injuries often require surgical fixation.
      Specific three-dimensional degrees of instability after spinal injury, which
      represent criteria for optimum treatment concepts, however, are still not well
      investigated. PURPOSE: The aim of this review therefore was to summarize and
      quantify multiplanar instability increases due to spinal injury from experimental
      studies. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Systematic review. METHODS: A systematic review of
      the literature was performed using keyword-based search on PubMed and Web of
      Science databases in order to detect all in vitro studies investigating the
      destabilizing effect of simulated and provoked traumatic injury in human spine
      specimens. Together with the experimental designs, the instability parameters
      range of motion, neutral zone and translation were extracted from the studies and
      evaluated regarding type and level of injury. RESULTS: A total of 59 studies was 
      included in this review, of which 43 studies investigated the effect of cervical 
      spine injury. Range of motion increase, which was reported in 58 studies, was
      generally lower compared to the neutral zone increase, given in 37 studies,
      despite of injury type and level. Instability increases were highest in
      flexion/extension for most injury types, while axial rotation was predominantly
      affected after cervical unilateral dislocation injury and lateral bending solely 
      after odontoid fracture. Whiplash injuries and wedge fractures were found to
      increase instability equally in all motion planes. CONCLUSIONS: Specific
      traumatic spinal injuries produce characteristic but complex three-dimensional
      degrees of instability, which depend on the type, level, and morphology of the
      injury. Future studies should expand research on the cervicothoracic, thoracic,
      and lumbosacral spine and should additionally investigate the destabilizing
      effects of the injury morphology as well as concomitant rib cage injuries in case
      of thoracic spinal injuries. Moreover, neutral zone and translation should be
      measured in addition to the range of motion, while mechanical injury simulation
      should be preferred to resection or transection of structures to ensure high
      comparability with the clinical situation.

TI  - An analysis of the rates of discontinuation and non-publication of colorectal
      cancer clinical trials.
PG  - 2529-2532
LID - 10.1007/s00384-021-03972-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Non-publication and premature discontinuation for clinical trials pose
      an ethical dilemma for trial participants, patients, clinicians, and researchers,
      as well as the general public as these studies receive significant public funding
      that may be further contributing to research waste. Here, we investigate the rate
      of trial discontinuation and non-publication among CRC trials using
      ClinicalTrials.gov. METHODS: We performed an advanced search on
      ClinicalTrials.gov pertaining to the treatment of CRC using the keyword
      colorectal cancer. For each clinical trial, links to the publication provided by 
      ClinicalTrials.gov were searched and verified to be correct. If a publication was
      unable to be found using the methods above, we attempted to contact the lead
      investigator via email for the reason for non-publication. RESULTS: Of the 123
      (123/428, 28.7%) discontinued trials, a reason for discontinuation was provided
      for 57 (57/123, 46.3%) trials. Of the 305 (305/428, 71.3%) completed trials, 244 
      (244/305, 80.0%) had a verifiable publication, while 61 (61/305, 20.0%) did not
      publish their findings or were unable to be located. CONCLUSION: We found that
      more than one-quarter of trials were prematurely ended, and almost one-third of
      completed trials did not publish their findings. Subjecting trial participants to
      potentially harmful treatments and interventions that fail to complete or publish
      study findings have the potential to undermine the patient-provider relationship,
      as well as public confidence in government-sponsored clinical trials.

      issues that have been raised. METHODS: We searched for peer-reviewed empirical
      studies on the application of algorithmic technologies in mental health care in
      the Scopus, Embase, and Association for Computing Machinery databases. A total of
      1078 relevant peer-reviewed applied studies were identified, which were narrowed 
      to 132 empirical research papers for review based on selection criteria.
      Conventional content analysis was undertaken to address our aims, and this was
      supplemented by a keyword-in-context analysis. RESULTS: We grouped the findings
      into the following five categories of technology: social media (53/132, 40.1%),
      smartphones (37/132, 28%), sensing technology (20/132, 15.1%), chatbots (5/132,
      3.8%), and miscellaneous (17/132, 12.9%). Most initiatives were directed toward
      detection and diagnosis. Most papers discussed privacy, mainly in terms of
      respecting the privacy of research participants. There was relatively little
      discussion of privacy in this context. A small number of studies discussed ethics
      directly (10/132, 7.6%) and indirectly (10/132, 7.6%). Legal issues were not
      substantively discussed in any studies, although some legal issues were discussed
      in passing (7/132, 5.3%), such as the rights of user subjects and privacy law
      compliance. CONCLUSIONS: Ethical and legal issues tend to not be explicitly
      addressed in empirical studies on algorithmic and data-driven technologies in
      mental health initiatives. Scholars may have considered ethical or legal matters 
      at the ethics committee or institutional review board stage. If so, this
      consideration seldom appears in published materials in applied research in any
      detail. The form itself of peer-reviewed papers that detail applied research in
      this field may well preclude a substantial focus on ethics and law. Regardless,
      we identified several concerns, including the near-complete lack of involvement
      of mental health service users, the scant consideration of algorithmic
      accountability, and the potential for overmedicalization and techno-solutionism. 
      Most papers were published in the computer science field at the pilot or
      exploratory stages. Thus, these technologies could be appropriated into practice 
      in rarely acknowledged ways, with serious legal and ethical implications.

TI  - Healthcare provider characteristics that influence the implementation of
      individual-level patient-centered outcome measure (PROM) and patient-reported
      experience measure (PREM) data across practice settings: a protocol for a mixed
      methods systematic review with a narrative synthesis.

LID - 10.1186/s13643-021-01725-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Substantial literature has highlighted the importance of
      patient-reported outcome and experience measures (PROMs and PREMs, respectively) 
      to collect clinically relevant information to better understand and address what 
      matters to patients. The purpose of this systematic review is to synthesize the
      evidence about how healthcare providers implement individual-level PROMs and
      PREMs data into daily practice. METHODS: This mixed methods systematic review
      protocol describes the design of our synthesis of the peer-reviewed research
      evidence (i.e., qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods), systematic
      reviews, organizational implementation projects, expert opinion, and grey
      literature. Keyword synonyms for "PROMs," PREMs," and "implementation" will be
      used to search eight databases (i.e., MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, 
      Embase, SPORTDiscus, Evidence-based Medicine Reviews, and ProQuest (Dissertation 
      and Theses)) with limiters of English from 2009 onwards. Study selection criteria
      include implementation at the point-of-care by healthcare providers in any
      practice setting. Eligible studies will be critically appraised using validated
      tools (e.g., Joanna Briggs Institute). Guided by the review questions, data
      extraction and synthesis will occur simultaneously to identify biographical
      information and methodological characteristics as well as classify study findings
      related to implementation processes and strategies. As part of the narrative
      synthesis approach, two frameworks will be utilized: (a) Consolidated Framework
      for Implementation Research (CFIR) to identify influential factors of PROMs and
      PREMs implementation and (b) Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change
      (ERIC) to illicit strategies. Data management will be undertaken using NVivo
      12(TM). DISCUSSION: Data from PROMs and PREMs are critical to adopt a
      person-centered approach to healthcare. Findings from this review will guide
      subsequent phases of a larger project that includes interviews and a
      consensus-building forum with end users to create guidelines for implementing
      PROMs and PREMs at the point of care. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The increasing research interest in sexual satisfaction corresponds
      to a large amount of studies which focus on different singular determinants
      without establishing a common model for its explanation. OBJECTIVES: The purpose 
      of this review is to systematically identify and evaluate the structure and
      results of the current research about sexual satisfaction in heterosexual women
      in a long-term relationship. METHODS: A systematic literature search using Web of
      Knowledge, ProQuest and PSYNDEX was conducted from January 2004 to October 2019. 
      In total, 1,649 studies published in the last 15 years were extracted from the
      databases with a systematic keyword search. Through a multistage evaluation
      process 204 studies met the inclusion criteria and described findings about
      sexual satisfaction as dependent variable. RESULTS: Research interest in sexual
      satisfaction increased notably in the last 5 years. Empirical analyses were
      predominantly based on data from North America whereas a considerably smaller
      share of research analyzed samples from Europe or Asia. Relationship variables
      were the most frequently analyzed predictors and included in more than half of
      the identified studies. Sexual behavior was most often analyzed in the form of
      frequency of sexual interactions. Contrariwise, sexual practices, communication
      about sexuality and sexual desire, and sexual thoughts received limited
      attention. Demographics were considered in one third of all studies. The
      inclusion of control variables was rare. Some important studies considered
      variables closely related to sexual satisfaction such as sexual dysfunction.
      CONCLUSION: Relationship satisfaction and the frequency of sexual interactions
      are identified as the most frequently confirmed predictors of sexual satisfaction
      across all evaluated studies. Results about the effects of pornography
      consumption, religion, and relationship duration showed the greatest
      inconsistency. In general, identified effects were often believed to result from 
      mediator variables like sexual desire or distracting thoughts. Rausch D,

TI  - Hotspot and Frontier Analysis of Exercise Training Therapy for Heart Failure
      Complicated With Depression Based on Web of Science Database and Big Data
      Analysis.
PG  - 665993
LID - 10.3389/fcvm.2021.665993 [doi]
AB  - Background: Exercise training has been extensively studied in heart failure (HF) 
      and psychological disorders, which has been shown to worsen each other. However, 
      our understanding of how exercise simultaneously protect heart and brain of HF
      patients is still in its infancy. The purpose of this study was to take advantage
      of big data techniques to explore hotspots and frontiers of mechanisms that
      protect the heart and brain simultaneously through exercise training. Methods: We
      studied the scientific publications on related research between January 1, 2003
      to December 31, 2020 from the WoS Core Collection. Research hotspots were
      assessed through open-source software, CiteSpace, Pajek, and VOSviewer. Big data 
      analysis and visualization were carried out using R, Cytoscape and Origin.
      Results: From 2003 to 2020, the study on HF, depression, and exercise
      simultaneously was the lowest of all research sequences (two-way ANOVAs, p <
      0.0001). Its linear regression coefficient r was 0.7641. The result of hotspot
      analysis of related keyword-driven research showed that inflammation and stress
      (including oxidative stress) were the common mechanisms. Through the further
      analyses, we noted that inflammation, stress, oxidative stress, apoptosis,
      reactive oxygen species, cell death, and the mechanisms related to mitochondrial 
      biogenesis/homeostasis, could be regarded as the primary mechanism targets to
      study the simultaneous intervention of exercise on the heart and brain of HF
      patients with depression. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate the potential
      mechanism targets by which exercise interferes with both the heart and brain for 
      HF patients with depression. We hope that they can boost the attention of other
      researchers and clinicians, and open up new avenues for designing more novel
      potential drugs to block heart-brain axis vicious circle.

TI  - ASTHMA IN A PATIENT WITH COVID-19: DOES IT PROTECT OR INCREASE THE RISKS?
PG  - 1245-1249
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim: To investigate theimpact of asthma co-morbidity on the
      susceptibility and clinical course of COVID-19 in asthma patients. PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: Materials and methods: Electronic databases of Pubmed and Google Scholar
      were searched using keyword searches. CONCLUSION: Conclusions: Despite previous
      concerns about the increased risk of Covid-19 among asthmatics, most studies have
      not shown an increase in Covid-19 incidence among asthmatics compared to the
      general population. A large number of studies that have investigate the role of
      concomitant asthma in the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19, show
      conflicting results and indicate numerous factors that may affect these
      processes, so there is a need for large-scale studies to adjust the result to
      concomitant factors, which will assess the true impact of asthma on
      susceptibility and severity of COVID-19. Based on the recommendations of GINA
      2020 regarding the management of asthma patients under Covid-19, potential
      protective effects of asthma therapy and the high risk of exacerbations when
      discontinuing basic therapy, we consider it appropriate to continue taking asthma
      patients therapy of asthma during a pandemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is an emerging health problem, but
      information on scientific production in this subject area is scarce. We aim to
      evaluate the scientific production on OSA from 2009 to 2018 to illustrate its
      worldwide distribution, topic areas, and ability to secure funding, as well as to
      describe international collaboration networks in this field. METHODS: Articles
      published between 2009 and 2018 were extracted from the Science Citation Index
      Expanded via Web of Science (WoS) using the search term "obstructive sleep apn*".
      Publication year, number and country of authors, journal, subject category, key
      words, funding source and number of citations received were recorded. We also
      conducted network analyses for key words and international collaboration.
      RESULTS: 12,666 articles on OSA were located, which had increased from 895
      documents in 2009 to 1592 in 2018. The progressive growth in scientific
      production on OSA had outpaced the growth rate of total WoS production since
      2012.50% of the articles declared some type of funding, with a citation index
      higher than manuscripts that were not funded. The manuscripts were distributed in
      journals from 135 subject categories of the WoS, and keyword distribution showed 
      a dispersed pattern with a high number of nodes. The international collaboration 
      rate was 18.2%, and the country network showed the United States as the hegemonic
      node. CONCLUSION: World production on OSA has grown at a higher rate than global 
      production and shows notable thematic dispersion as well as a high ability to
      secure funding, which increases its impact.

      meta-analysis.

AB  - PURPOSE: To provide a direct comparison between two important aspects related to 
      talar neck fractures management - surgical approaches and fixation strategies.
      DATA SOURCES: A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed using PubMed,
      SciELO, and gray literature databases. The keyword "talus fracture" and the
      combined terms "talus neck fracture AND surgical approach" and "talus neck
      fracture AND fixation strategy" were used. STUDY SELECTION: Study selection, data
      extraction, and the risk of bias assessment were performed following the
      Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA)
      guidelines. Searches were limited to human studies and the English and
      Portuguese. Inclusion criteria were articles in full text that reported on any
      aspect of surgical approach and fixation strategy for talus neck fractures.
      Exclusion criteria were skeletally immature patients, mean follow-up of less than
      12 months, studies that did not use the Hawkins classification system, primary
      treatment of arthrodesis, studies published before year 2000, and studies
      published in languages other than English and Portuguese. DATA EXTRACTION: Basic 
      information was collected including journal, author(s), year published, level of 
      evidence, number of fractures, and follow-up. Specific information was collected 
      including fracture classification, surgical approach, fixation strategy,
      complication rate, type of complication(s), and outcome measurement(s). DATA
      SYNTHESIS: Fixed-effects model was used for meta-analysis. The choice for
      surgical approach(es) and fixation strategy was stratified based on fracture
      classification. Complication rate, type of complication(s), and outcome
      measurement(s) were calculated for all studies and delineated by fracture
      classification. CONCLUSION: There is a significant correlation between poor
      scores and poor fracture reduction, but not with the modified Hawkins
      classification, surgical approach, and fixation strategy. The presence of an open
      talus neck fracture-dislocation jeopardizes the functional outcome, increasing
      the risk of complications. The overall avascular necrosis and post-traumatic
      osteoarthritis event rate was 0.279 and 0.400, respectively. Both complications
      were highly correlated to higher energy fracture patterns and to the use of
      combined approaches, but not to fixation strategy. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: I
      (systematic review and meta-analysis).

TI  - Efficacy of cogmed working memory training program in improving working memory in
      school-age children with and without neurological insults or disorders: A
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 1-13
LID - 10.1080/21622965.2021.1920943 [doi]
AB  - This meta-analysis assessed the efficacy of the Cogmed Working Memory Training
      program in improving near-transfer measures (verbal and visuospatial working
      memory) and far-transfer measures (attention, executive function, and academic
      achievement) in school-age children with and without neurological insults or
      disorders. Relevant studies were searched in databases and clinical trial
      registries using the keyword Cogmed. Ten published studies and unpublished data
      from one study met the inclusion criteria. Hedges g was calculated for each
      outcome measure obtained at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 3-6 month
      time points. Analysis compared outcome measures in the control versus
      experimental groups and examined the role of moderators on treatment effects
      (control group intervention, intervention environment). Data revealed significant
      medium-size effects of the Cogmed program in improving verbal and visuospatial
      working memory post-intervention and for verbal working memory only at the 3-6
      month time point. However, the training did not generalize to the far-transfer
      measures. Analyses indicated that only the type of intervention provided for the 
      control group moderated treatment effects on verbal and visual working memory.
      Meta-analytic findings suggest that the Cogmed program leads to short-term
      improvements and in some cases, long-term improvements in working memory in
      school-age children; however, these effects may not generalize to far-transfer
      measures.

AB  - Background: Cerebral angiography including internal and external carotid artery
      injections is crucial in young patients with a spontaneous subdural hematoma.
      Case Description: We present the first reported case of an accessory meningeal
      artery aneurysm in a 46-year-old male with a history of hypertension that led to 
      a spontaneous nontraumatic acute subdural hematoma. A PubMed review of the
      literature was performed using a keyword search to identify cases examining
      nontraumatic spontaneous intracranial hematomas related to meningeal artery
      aneurysms. The literature review summarizes all published reports of middle
      meningeal artery aneurysms resulting in nontraumatic acute intracranial bleeds.
      The patient underwent successful coiling of the accessory meningeal artery.
      Conclusion: We propose endovascular treatment for accessory meningeal artery
      aneurysms and emphasize the utility of angiography of internal and external
      carotid arteries in a patient with an unexplained intracranial hematoma.

AB  - The current review looks for relationships between results from biomarker studies
      with micronucleus and health effects related to reproduction and children. In
      adults, an age related increase in MN is well known as well as associations with 
      environmental exposures especially air pollution from traffic and smoking.
      Literature searches in PubMED and SCOPUS were performed with the following
      keywords reproduction, children, micronuclei, health effects. In total 162
      studies were identified with the keyword children. Concerning children and health
      and children and environmental exposures, the titles and abstracts of a total of 
      162 publications were screened for language, inclusion of data from children and 
      selected according to a study selection chart. 9 studies were included for
      children and health, and 21 studies for children and environmental exposures,
      with 12 in buccal cells and 9 in lymphocytes. The publications were read and
      included in tables if data on controls was available. MN frequencies were
      collected for peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), reticulocytes or buccal cells 
      (BC) and reported as Mean +/- SD or Median (IQR). The Mean frequency Ratio, MRi, 
      corresponding to the MN mean for study persons divided by MN mean for control
      persons was stated as reported in the publication or calculated by us from the
      data in the publication, where possible. Our systematic analysis revealed a
      number of positive associations of MN frequencies as a marker of increased health
      risk in relation to reproduction as well as child health. The majority of studies
      reported with children concerns exposures of children as well as maternal
      exposures and newborn health with MN as a biomarker of exposure. Exposure
      monitoring by MN as biomarker is also reported in studies of school children
      however most often not related to health effects. The MRis are found in ranges
      from 1 to 5.5 most studies around 2. As far as MN frequencies in children and
      exposure are concerned, the MRis range from 0.9 to 5.5, with a range from 1.3-4.9
      for lymphocytes and from 1.5 to 2.5 in buccal cells, except for two studies with 
      no differences found between cases and controls. Only one study is available for 
      MRi calculation in reticulocytes with the value of 2.3. These data are supporting
      MN as a relevant biomarker for children health. However, the data is mostly from 
      small studies with different protocol leaving out the possibility of metanalyses 
      and even statistical comparisons among studies. The actual risk from elevated MNs
      in children waits large cohort studies with pooled datasets as performed with MN 
      measured in adults. Introduction of buccal cells as non invasive alternative to
      lymphocytes is increasing and as with the lymphocytes standardised protocols are 
      recommended to enable comparative studies and metaanalyses.

TI  - A Global Overview of COVID-19 Research in the Pediatric Field: Bibliometric
      Review.
PG  - e24791
LID - 10.2196/24791 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a great number of
      papers have been published in the pediatric field. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess 
      research around the globe on COVID-19 in the pediatric field by bibliometric
      analysis, identifying publication trends and topic dissemination and showing the 
      relevance of publishing authors, institutions, and countries. METHODS: The Scopus
      database was comprehensively searched for all indexed documents published between
      January 1, 2020, and June 11, 2020, dealing with COVID-19 in the pediatric
      population (0-18 years). A machine learning bibliometric methodology was applied 
      to evaluate the total number of papers and citations, journal and publication
      types, the top productive institutions and countries and their scientific
      collaboration, and core keywords. RESULTS: A total of 2301 papers were retrieved,
      with an average of 4.8 citations per article. Of this, 1078 (46.9%) were research
      articles, 436 (18.9%) were reviews, 363 (15.8%) were letters, 186 (8.1%) were
      editorials, 7 (0.3%) were conference papers, and 231 (10%) were categorized as
      others. The studies were published in 969 different journals, headed by The
      Lancet. The retrieved papers were published by a total of 12,657 authors from 114
      countries. The most productive countries were the United States, China, and
      Italy. The four main clusters of keywords were pathogenesis and clinical
      characteristics (keyword occurrences: n=2240), public health issues (n=352),
      mental health (n=82), and therapeutic aspects (n=70). CONCLUSIONS: In the
      pediatric field, a large number of articles were published within a limited
      period on COVID-19, testifying to the rush to spread new findings on the topic in
      a timely manner. The leading authors, countries, and institutions evidently
      belonged to the most impacted geographical areas. A focus on the pediatric
      population was often included in general articles, and pediatric research about
      COVID-19 mainly focused on the clinical features, public health issues, and
      psychological impact of the disease.

PG  - 619-628
LID - 10.1089/cmb.2020.0364 [doi]
AB  - Biomedical Entity Explorer (BEE) is a web server that can search for biomedical
      entities from a database of six biomedical entity types (gene, miRNA, drug,
      disease, single nucleotide polymorphism [SNP], pathway) and their gene
      associations. The search results can be explored using intersections, unions, and
      negations. BEE has integrated biomedical entities from 16 databases (Ensemble,
      PharmGKB, Genetic Home Reference, Tarbase, Mirbase, NCI Thesaurus, DisGeNET,
      Linked life data, UMLS, GSEA MsigDB, Reactome, KEGG, Gene Ontology, HGVD,
      SNPedia, and dbSNP) based on their gene associations and built a database with
      their synonyms, descriptions, and links containing individual details. Users can 
      enter the keyword of one or more entities and select the type of entity for which
      they want to know the relationship for and by using set operations such as union,
      negation, and intersection, they can navigate the search results more clearly. We
      believe that BEE will not only be useful for biologists querying for complex
      associations between entities, but can also be a good starting point for general 
      users searching for biomedical entities. BEE is accessible at
      (http://bike-bee.snu.ac.kr).

TI  - Dental Care in the Arab Countries During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An
      Infodemiological Study.
PG  - 2153-2162
LID - 10.2147/RMHP.S310023 [doi]
AB  - Background: Twitter is a powerful platform which could be used to reflect on the 
      demand and supply of dental services during a pandemic. The aim of this study was
      to examine the nature and dissemination of COVID-19 information related to
      dentistry on Twitter platform Arabic database during the COVID-19 pandemic.
      Methodology: One hundred and fifty independent searches with a combination of
      keywords for both COVID-19 and dentistry from a preselected Arabic keyword were
      carried out for the period from the 2nd of March (first confirmed cases of
      COVID-19) to the 6th of July 2020. Tweets were filtered to remove duplicate and
      unrelated tweets. The suitable tweets were 1,150. After calibration, two
      examiners coded the tweets following two main themes: COVID-19 and oral
      health-related information. Tweets were then compared with COVID-19 daily events 
      in the Arab countries as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO).
      Descriptive analysis was performed to present the overview of the findings using 
      Microsoft Excel. Results: The most retweeted information was the help with urgent
      consultation or emergency dental treatment during COVID-19 tweeted by a dentist. 
      There were 673 retweets and 1,116 likes of this tweet. The most common tweets
      related to oral health were needs of dental treatment (n=462, 39.5%) of which,
      toothaches or wisdom tooth problems constituted 48% of the related tweets.
      Conclusion: Based on the results of this study, it is obvious that social media
      users reacted to the COVID-19 threat to dental practices. Twitter as one of the
      social media platforms served as a connection between dental health professionals
      and patients.

TI  - A Scientometric Analysis of the 100 Most Cited Articles on Pallidotomy.
PG  - 463-473
LID - 10.1159/000516237 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pallidotomy is the oldest stereotactically performed neurosurgical
      procedure for movement disorders. Consequently, there is a wealth of literature
      available on the topic. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this analysis was to identify the 
      top-cited articles on pallidotomy in order to discern the origins, spread, the
      current trends, and the future directions of this surgical procedure. METHODS: We
      performed a search of the Web of Science database on 19 October 2020 using the
      keyword "pallidotomy." The top-100 cited articles found were arranged in
      descending order on the basis of citation count (CC) and citation per year (CY). 
      Relevant conclusions were derived. RESULTS: The 100 top-cited articles were
      published between 1961 and 2017, in 24 journals. The average CC and CY were 118.1
      (range - 856-46) and 5.326 (range - 29.52-2.09), respectively. The 3 most
      prolific authors were Lang AE (Neurologist - Toronto), Lozano AM (Neurosurgeon - 
      Toronto), and Vitek JL (Neurologist - Atlanta). The Journal of Neurosurgery
      published the highest number of top-cited articles [Neurology. 1960;10:61-9]. The
      maximum articles were from the USA. University of Toronto and Emory University
      were the most productive institutions. CONCLUSIONS: Pallidotomy has gone through 
      several ebbs and flows. Unilateral pallidotomy is currently recommended for the
      treatment of motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease and dystonia. The need for
      further research and improved technology to make the technique safer and prove
      its efficacy is highlighted, especially keeping in mind a large number of
      populations to which the prohibitively expensive deep brain stimulation is
      unavailable.

PG  - 359-362
LID - 10.3760/cma.j.cn121094-20200224-00078 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To further improve the awareness of the clinical feature of acute
      diquat poisoning. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 4 cases of
      acute diquat poisoning with epileptoid seizure as the main clinical
      manifestation, which were admitted and diagnosed by the Characteristic Medical
      Center of Chinese People's Armed Police Force from January 1, 2017 to December
      31, 2019. Take "Diquat" or "Deiquat" or "Reward" as keyword search for CNKI,
      Pubmed, and EMbase in both Chinese and English. The date of literature retrieval 
      was from the database founding to December 31, 2019. Results: Of the 4 patients, 
      3 were male and 1 female, with an average age of 28 years (22-33 years) . The
      estimated dose was 8-20 g. All patients were treated with gastric lavage,
      catharsis, fluid replacement, blood perfusion, and in the early stage of
      treatment of epileptic seizures, the initial routine antiepileptic drugs had poor
      effect. Then propofol and midazolam were injected into the treatment. The
      epilepsy was relieved, but the condition deteriorated rapidly, and the patients
      died eventually. The literature search retrieved 3 patients in the 3 literatures 
      included in the study were analyzed, and their clinical course was similar to
      that of 4 cases in the center. Necropsy was performedon all 3 patients, and the
      results were cerebral edema, diffuse cerebral edema, and hemorrhage around the
      basal ganglia. Conclusion: Acute diquat poisoning can cause epileptic seizures.
      Once it occurs, the disease progresses rapidly and the prognosis is poor. The
      combination of large dose of sedative drugs can be used to treat epilepsy in
      order to improve the prognosis.

TI  - The Bibliometric Literature on Scopus and WoS: The Medicine and Environmental
      Sciences Categories as Case of Study.
LID - 5851 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18115851 [doi]
AB  - In a broad sense, science can be understood as the knowledge contained in
      scientific manuscripts published in scientific journals. Scientific databases
      index only those journals that reach certain quality standards. Therefore,
      research and dissemination of scientific knowledge are essential activities for
      the growth of science itself. The aim of this manuscript is to assess the
      situation of medicine and environmental sciences among the bibliometric
      literature and to put it in perspective with the overall bibliometric
      publications in all scientific fields. The main countries publishing bibliometric
      manuscripts are China, USA and Spain. The latter country is ranked three out of
      the top five institutions according to the Scopus and WoS databases. In both
      databases, the average scientific collaboration of the top 20 institutions offers
      the same result, 41%. According to Scopus, the main subject categories in which
      this research falls are social sciences (38%), computer science (26%) and
      medicine (23%), while the environmental sciences category has 8%. In the analysis
      of the Medicine category alone, it has been observed that 136 countries have
      contributions in this field. The main countries are the United States, China and 
      the United Kingdom. In the field of medicine, the main areas studied were:
      Epidemiology, Pediatrics, Orthopedics, Cardiology, Neurosurgery, Radiology,
      Ophthalmology, Oncology, Plastic Surgery and Psychiatry. With respect to
      environmental sciences, less international dissemination has been found, with
      only 83 countries having worked in this field. The main ones are China, Spain and
      the United States. Regarding the top 10 institutions, it can be stated that only 
      Spain and China are relevant. Spain focuses on sustainability and China on the
      environment. The result of an independent keyword analysis of all published
      bibliometric manuscripts has shown that the main clusters are: Mapping Science
      (29%), Research Productivity (23%), Medicine (20%), Environmental Sciences (12%),
      Psychology (7%), Nursing (6%) and Engineering (4%). In short, medicine and
      environmental sciences are the most relevant areas in the field of bibliometrics 
      after social sciences and computer sciences.

TI  - Assessment of the Toxicity of Quantum Dots through Biliometric Analysis.
LID - 5768 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18115768 [doi]
AB  - Along with the rapid development of nanotechnology, the biosafety of quantum dots
      (QDs), a widely used kind of nanoparticles, has grabbed the attentions of
      researchers, because QDs have excellent and unique optical properties that other 
      commonly used nanoparticles, like walled carbon nanotubes, do not have. The
      understanding of the toxicity of QDs is an important premise for their
      application in wider fields, including biology and medicine. This study sought to
      analyze scientific publications on the toxicity of QDs and to construct a
      bibliometric model for qualitative and quantitative evaluation of these
      publications over the past decade, which visually presented the status quo and
      future development trend on the toxicological study of QDs. A search for data
      using the triple blind method revealed that, as of 31 December 2018, there were
      5269 papers published on the toxicity of QDs. RSC ADVANCES (5-year IF, 3.096)
      ranked first in the number of publications. China had the largest number of
      publications (2233) and the highest H-index (119), but the United States was
      still the leading country with regards to the quality of the research. LIU Y (106
      publications) published the most papers, while Hardman R (304 co-citations) had
      the most co-citations. The keyword "walled carbon nanotube" ranked first in the
      research frontier. The findings not only determine a development trend of the
      toxicological study of QDs, but also identify further research directions in this
      field.

TI  - Equine Rehabilitation: A Scoping Review of the Literature.
LID - 1508 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani11061508 [doi]
AB  - Injuries to the locomotor system are a common problem in athletic horses.
      Veterinarians address these injuries using appropriate medical, surgical, and
      pharmacological treatments. During or after recovery from the initial injury,
      horses may be treated for functional locomotor deficits using specific
      rehabilitation techniques aimed at restoring full athletic performance. This
      study reviews the literature to identify which rehabilitative techniques have
      been used most frequently in horses over the past 20 years, the protocols that
      were used, and the outcomes of the treatments in naturally occurring injuries and
      diseases. Publications were identified using keyword selection (Equine Athlete OR
      Equine OR Horse) AND (Rehabilitation OR Physiotherapy OR Physical Therapy). After
      removing duplicates and screening papers for suitability, 49 manuscripts were
      included in the study. The majority of publications that met the inclusion
      criteria were narrative reviews (49%) in which the authors cited the relatively
      small number of published evidence-based studies supplemented by personal
      experience. Observational/descriptive studies were also popular (35%). Randomized
      control trials accounted for only 10%. The most frequently reported
      rehabilitation techniques were exercise, electrotherapy, and hydrotherapy. The
      findings highlight the need for further information regarding type of
      intervention, parameterization, and outcomes of equine rehabilitation in clinical
      practice.

TI  - Visualization and Analysis of Mapping Knowledge Domains for Food Waste Studies.
LID - 5143 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18105143 [doi]
AB  - Food waste and loss is a global issue involving ethics, society, the environment,
      and the economy. However, there is a lack of systematic and visual scientific
      knowledge and graph methods to study the precedents of this field's development
      over time. The article is based on the scientific knowledge graph research of
      articles published in the past 22 years to review the latest food waste research 
      developments. The study will be conducted from the following perspectives:
      country/region, institution, author, journal, keyword co-occurrence, and article 
      co-citation. It turns out that in the past eight years, food waste research has
      grown rapidly. A total of 8298 research articles have been published in 8064
      journals and 176 Web of Science (WOS) subject categories. Research shows in the
      past 20 years. The main research hotspots were anaerobic digestion, biogas
      production, composting, biological hydrogen production, and innovation in system 
      management methods. In the future, efficient and multitask biological value-added
      conversion technology, systematization of food-supply-chain decision-making aid
      models, and research on differences in management strategies may become the
      frontiers of research.

TI  - Workplace Health in Kentucky: A Statewide Comparison.
LID - 5473 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18105473 [doi]
AB  - The objectives of this study were to assess the state of Kentucky's workplace
      health promotion and occupational safety and health programs, to ensure the
      ability to comprehend any possible trends over the past six years in the state's 
      progress in offering workplace health promotion and health protection programs,
      to compare the results of this survey with the 2013 Kentucky state-wide
      assessment, and to identify gaps in Kentucky's workplace health promotion and
      occupational safety and health based on Total Worker Health((R)) (TWH) concepts. 
      Using Qualtrics research software, the Workplace Health in America assessment was
      sent to companies located in Kentucky and having 10 or more employees.
      Participants were identified using Dun and Bradstreet's Hoover's database. The
      results showed that, as with the 2013 survey, larger workplaces significantly
      were more likely to offer workplace health promotion programs than smaller
      companies (X(2) = 24.30; p < 0.001). However, more companies (78%) reported
      offering programs compared to the 2013 assessment (49%). Given the results of the
      current study as compared to the statewide assessment conducted in 2013,
      Kentucky's WHP is moving in a positive direction; yet, there is still much to be 
      done. There remains a strong need to provide cost-effective and accessible
      resources for all elements of TWH to small workplaces.

TI  - Antithrombotic Therapy for Secondary Prevention in Patients with
      Non-Cardioembolic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack: A Systematic Review.
LID - 447 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/life11050447 [doi]
AB  - Stroke embodies one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. We
      aimed to provide a comprehensive insight into the effectiveness and safety of
      antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants in the secondary prevention of ischemic
      stroke or transient ischemic attack. A systematic search for randomized
      controlled trials, comparing antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy versus aspirin
      or placebo among patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, was 
      performed in order to summarize data regarding the different regimens.
      Keyword-based searches in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases
      were conducted until the 1st of January 2021. Our search explored 46 randomized
      controlled trials involving ten antiplatelet agents, six combinations with
      aspirin, and four anticoagulant therapies. The review of the literature reflects 
      that antiplatelet therapy improves outcome in patients with ischemic stroke or
      transient ischemic attack. Monotherapy proved to be an effective and safe choice,
      especially in patients with a high risk of bleeding. Intensified antiplatelet
      regimens further improve stroke recurrence; however, bleeding rate increases
      while mortality remains unaffected. Supplementing the clinical judgment of stroke
      treatment, assessment of bleeding risk is warranted to identify patients with the
      highest benefit of treatment intensification.

TI  - Educational quality of YouTube videos on musculoskeletal ultrasound.
PG  - 4243-4251
LID - 10.1007/s10067-021-05793-6 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVES: A progressively growing number of rheumatologists have
      integrated musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSUS) as a prized tool in their daily
      clinical practice over the past two decades. Lately, YouTube is often used by
      healthcare professionals as an educational tool. This study aimed to analyze the 
      quality of educational information available on YouTube pertaining to MSUS.
      METHOD: We performed a search using the keyword "musculoskeletal ultrasound" on
      YouTube in January 2021. Of the first 200 videos screened, 147 met the inclusion 
      criteria. The quality and reliability of the videos were evaluated using the
      global quality score (GQS) and modified DISCERN score, and their popularity was
      assessed using the Video Power Index (VPI). RESULTS: Of the 147 videos evaluated,
      58 (39.5%) were of high quality, 30 (20.4%) were of moderate quality, while 59
      (40.1%) were of low quality. The modified DISCERN score and the duration of the
      videos were significantly higher in the high-quality videos than the moderate-
      and low-quality videos (p < 0.001 for all). The median number of views per day,
      likes, comments, and the popularity of the videos assessed with VPI were
      significantly higher in the high- and moderate-quality group compared to the
      low-quality videos (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.007, and p < 0.001,
      respectively). CONCLUSION: The quality of YouTube videos as an educational source
      on MSUS is unsatisfactory. Professional organizations and physicians should
      consider creating more high-quality MSUS videos. YouTube should consider
      filtering out poor-quality videos in collaboration with experts in the field. Key
      Points * Although rheumatologists are increasingly using ultrasound as an
      extension of their exam, accessing musculoskeletal ultrasound training is still
      facing some challenges. * YouTube is commonly used as an educational source by
      medical students and healthcare professionals. * Approximately 60% of the videos

TI  - Review of menopausal palpitations measures.
PG  - 5
LID - 10.1186/s40695-021-00063-6 [doi]
AB  - Palpitations are reported commonly by women around the time of menopause as
      skipped, missed, irregular, and/or exaggerated heartbeats or heart pounding.
      However, much less is known about palpitations than other menopausal symptoms
      such as vasomotor symptoms. The objective of this review was to integrate
      evidence on menopausal palpitations measures. Keyword searching was done in
      PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycINFO for English-language, descriptive articles
      containing data on menopause and palpitations and meeting other pre-specified
      inclusion criteria. Of 670 articles, 110 met inclusion criteria and were included
      in the review. Results showed that 11 different measures were used across
      articles, with variability within and between measures. Inconsistencies in the
      wording of measurement items, recall periods, and response options were observed 
      even when standardized measures were used. Most measures were limited to
      assessing symptom presence and severity. Findings suggest that efforts should be 
      undertaken to (1) standardize conceptual and operational definitions of
      menopausal palpitations and (2) develop a patient-friendly, conceptually clear,
      psychometrically sound measure of menopausal palpitations.

TI  - What do people post on social media relative to low back pain? A content analysis
      of Australian data.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Low back pain is the leading contributor to the global disability
      burden. The Global Spine Care Initiative (GSCI) recommend patient-centred care to
      stem the cost of low back pain. One way to enhance patient-centred care is by
      better understanding what is relevant for people with low back pain. Exploring
      social media posts about low back pain could offer this insight and provide
      valuable information for health care professionals to facilitate active
      participation in patient-centred care. METHODS: We used an inductive content
      analysis method. In the form of social media posts, data on Twitter and Instagram
      were collected from June to August 2018. The posts were geo-targeted to
      Australia. We recorded the number of status broadcasts that contained a low back 
      pain keyword and responses. We developed a codebook to describe the data and
      applied it to identify low back pain themes. RESULTS: We analysed 768 posts
      containing 457 status broadcasts and 311 responses. Almost half (49%) of status
      broadcasts about low back pain seemed to seek validation. Expressing sympathy
      (31%) was the most common response to a status broadcast about low back pain.
      There were no public responses to 76% of status broadcasts about low back pain.
      Our analysis yielded two core themes, "hear my pain" and "I feel for you".
      CONCLUSIONS: Posts about low back pain on social media often seem to suggest that
      the person posting is seeking validation. Responses typically express sympathy or
      a shared experience; yet, there is no response to most social media posts about
      low back pain.

TI  - A Retrospective Evaluation of the Prevalence of Cracked Teeth Among an Adult
      Population in Nevada.
LID - 10.14744/eej.2020.86548 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the distribution and characteristics of cracked teeth in a
      Southern Nevada population attending the dental clinics of the School of Dental
      Medicine, University of Nevada, Las Vegas (SDM, UNLV). METHODS: A retrospective
      keyword search of the clinical notes of SDM, UNLV patient charts in AxiUm was
      performed using the search terms 'crack' and 'fracture' to discern the number of 
      patients that had clinically identifiable teeth with cracks, and which teeth (if 
      any) had documented symptoms consistent with the cracks. The inclusion criteria
      for the record search were individuals >/=18 years old, seen at the dental clinic
      between 2010 and 2018. Demographic data were analyzed using a Chi-square test
      against the demographics for Clark County's population. RESULTS: 893 patients
      presented with cracked teeth, of which 41% had documented symptoms. Patients in
      the 45-54 age range had the highest number of teeth with cracks (P<0.001). Males 
      comprised 49% of the cases. Caucasians (58.9%) and African Americans (21.1%)
      represented a majority of the population with cracked teeth (P<0.0001). 1st and
      2nd molars had the highest predilection for fractures (59.8%). CONCLUSION:
      Mandibular and maxillary first and second molars were amongst the highest teeth
      affected with cracks.

TI  - New learning area in laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer: YouTube(R) or
      WebSurg(R)?
LID - 10.4103/jmas.JMAS_300_20 [doi]
AB  - Background: Laparoscopic gastrectomy cannot be performed routinely in many
      centres, because there is still no standardisation in the centres where it is
      performed, and therefore, new learning areas are needed for residents working in 
      these centres for surgical training. These areas are various courses, video
      training sets and video platforms watched over the internet. The most frequently 
      used platforms are YouTube((R)) and WebSurg((R)). Our aim is to compare these two
      online video platforms in terms of laparoscopic gastrectomy and to evaluate the
      contribution of video platforms to surgical training and whether they have
      sufficient technical quality. Materials and Methods: We made a search on
      YouTube((R)) and WebSurg((R)) using the keyword 'laparoscopic gastrectomy' on 13 
      November 2020. A total of 143 videos were analysed, 111 of them on YouTube((R))
      and 32 on WebSurg((R)). All these videos were examined by two surgical
      oncologists experienced in laparoscopic gastrectomy and using laparoscopy in
      their daily practice. Results: The average video duration was 53.54 min in the
      YouTube((R)) group and 18.20 min in the WebSurg((R)) group, and this difference
      was found to be statistically significant between the two groups. According to
      the LGSS based on surgical procedures, the average score of WebSurg((R)) videos
      was 10.37 and of YouTube((R)) videos was 5.55, and there was a statistically
      significant difference between the two groups. Conclusions: Today, video
      platforms have started to play a major role in surgical training. Of these
      platforms examined, WebSurg((R)) is superior to YouTube((R)) in terms of
      education and quality, but these platforms still have some deficiencies and need 
      regulation.

TI  - The application of procalcitonin in respiratory diseases: an evaluation of the
      current research literature.
PG  - 5329-5340
LID - 10.21037/apm-21-840 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Procalcitonin (PCT) can effectively identify bacterial infections and
      can be used for risk prediction and antimicrobial treatment in patients with
      unexplained fever and critically ill patients. In this study, statistical
      analyses of the literature were performed to clarify the application and research
      status of PCT in respiratory diseases. Future research directions are discussed. 
      METHODS: A literature search was conducted using the Science Citation Index
      Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) database in the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC).
      Published literature between 1995 and February 6, 2021 were searched using the
      following strategies: subject term = procalcitonin; and Web of Science categories
      = Respiratory System. Using the Citespace software, the literature on the
      application of PCT in patients with respiratory diseases was analyzed in terms of
      annual publication status, subject distribution, country/institution
      distribution, journal distribution, author distribution, and keywords. RESULTS: A
      total of 542 related research literatures were identified, with the number of
      published papers and the number of literature citations increasing yearly.
      Research was mainly concentrated in the United States, China, Switzerland, and
      other countries, with countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States,
      and Canada being involved in international collaborations. Research institutions 
      were mainly universities or hospitals such as the University Hospital of Basel,
      University of Barcelona, and Northwestern University. In particular, the
      University Hospital of Basel had extensive inter-hospital collaborations. Stolz
      et al. published many related papers, but the centrality value was low. Authors
      including Christ-Crain M, Schuetz P, and Stolz D were highly cited. Journals such
      as the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Chest, and the
      European Respiratory Journal were more influential. Keyword analysis showed that 
      sepsis and pneumonia are the current hot topics. CONCLUSIONS: Related papers
      mainly focused on respiratory infections, especially sepsis and pneumonia. There 
      were also a small number of studies suggesting that PCT is related to tumors.

      regarding the quality of data, educational power, and accuracy of the sources.
      Materials and Methods: Most viewed popular visual content returned by YTb in
      reply to the keyword "laparoscopic adrenalectomy" were involved in the research
      protocol. The quality of the data, educational power, and the accuracy and
      reliability of the sources were assessed by applying new scoring systems. A novel
      scoring method estimated technical quality. The 10 most viewed videos in the WS
      were compared with 10 YTb videos with the highest technical scores. Results:
      Scoring systems measuring the quality of data and educational power of the mostly
      viewed WS visual content revealed higher scores than those of the most
      technically qualified 10 YTb videos (10 videos having the highest laparoscopic
      adrenalectomy scoring system scores [LASS-S]; P = .021; P = .003; P = .025,
      respectively). Also, there was no significant difference between the top 10 most 
      viewed WS videos and 10 YTb videos having the highest LASS-S in terms of LASS-S
      (P = .34). Conclusions: Although WS videos were passed through a professional
      reviewing process, and were mostly provided by academicians, they remained below 
      the expected quality. The presented research showed that attentively chosen YTb
      content on laparoscopic adrenalectomy is almost as accurate as WS content.
      Notwithstanding all its limitations, the informative power or potential of YTb
      should not be neglected.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by the
      third known zoonotic coronavirus. It is a disease that does not spare any age
      group. The scientific community has been inundated with information since
      January. This review aims to summarise pertinent information related to COVID-19 
      in children. METHODS: A literature search was conducted in 2020 on the PubMed,
      MEDLINE, and Embase databases, with the keyword "COVID 19" and "children". A
      bibliographic search of articles included was also undertaken. The abstracts were
      scanned to assess their appropriateness to be included in this narrative review. 
      This was updated on the 11th April, 2020. RESULTS: The aetiology, transmission,
      incubation, pathophysiology, clinical features and complications, and management 
      are discussed. CONCLUSION: Our understanding of COVID-19 is evolving as more
      reports are published. The growth of SARS-CoV2 is limited in children and they
      are often asymptomatic. The disease course is also milder. Continued research to 
      understand its effect on children is important to help us manage the disease in
      these vulnerable populations in a timely fashion.

TI  - Effective Training Data Extraction Method to Improve Influenza Outbreak
      Prediction from Online News Articles: Deep Learning Model Study.
PG  - e23305
LID - 10.2196/23305 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Each year, influenza affects 3 to 5 million people and causes 290,000
      to 650,000 fatalities worldwide. To reduce the fatalities caused by influenza,
      several countries have established influenza surveillance systems to collect
      early warning data. However, proper and timely warnings are hindered by a 1- to
      2-week delay between the actual disease outbreaks and the publication of
      surveillance data. To address the issue, novel methods for influenza surveillance
      and prediction using real-time internet data (such as search queries,
      microblogging, and news) have been proposed. Some of the currently popular
      approaches extract online data and use machine learning to predict influenza
      occurrences in a classification mode. However, many of these methods extract
      training data subjectively, and it is difficult to capture the latent
      characteristics of the data correctly. There is a critical need to devise new
      approaches that focus on extracting training data by reflecting the latent
      characteristics of the data. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we propose an effective
      method to extract training data in a manner that reflects the hidden features and
      improves the performance by filtering and selecting only the keywords related to 
      influenza before the prediction. METHODS: Although word embedding provides a
      distributed representation of words by encoding the hidden relationships between 
      various tokens, we enhanced the word embeddings by selecting keywords related to 
      the influenza outbreak and sorting the extracted keywords using the Pearson
      correlation coefficient in order to solely keep the tokens with high correlation 
      with the actual influenza outbreak. The keyword extraction process was followed
      by a predictive model based on long short-term memory that predicts the influenza
      outbreak. To assess the performance of the proposed predictive model, we used and
      compared a variety of word embedding techniques. RESULTS: Word embedding without 
      our proposed sorting process showed 0.8705 prediction accuracy when 50.2 keywords
      were selected on average. Conversely, word embedding using our proposed sorting
      process showed 0.8868 prediction accuracy and an improvement in prediction
      accuracy of 12.6%, although smaller amounts of training data were selected, with 
      only 20.6 keywords on average. CONCLUSIONS: The sorting stage empowers the
      embedding process, which improves the feature extraction process because it acts 
      as a knowledge base for the prediction component. The model outperformed other
      current approaches that use flat extraction before prediction.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: The creation of an ontology may enable providers to more
      definitively engage the public in evidence-based and meaningful discussions about
      women's health. The goal of this study is to review and analyze the current
      social media status of minimally invasive gynecologic surgery (MIGS) on Twitter
      and create a tag ontology. DESIGN: Tag ontologies are lists of hashtags used to
      standardize searches within a social media platform. We examined trending terms
      and influencers on Twitter on the basis of the keyword "MIGS." We then compiled a
      list of top hashtags on the basis of the number of tweets from January 2018 to
      August 2020. Terms were identified with manual Twitter queries and Symplur
      Signals and selected for inclusion in the ontology on the basis of frequency of
      use and clinical relevance. The ontology was then categorized by pelvic disease
      and intervention and reviewed/supplemented by key social media influencers for
      inclusivity. SETTING: N/A PATIENTS: N/A INTERVENTIONS: N/A MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN 
      RESULTS: We identified 4550 tweets and 1836 users while searching #MIGS in August
      2020. Twenty-nine terms were included in our ontology, which were then
      subcategorized into 6 groups (uterine pathology, adnexal pathology, menstruation,
      pelvic pathology, pelvic pain, and other). CONCLUSION: Our study has created an
      ontology specific to the MIGS on the basis of Twitter usage over the last 2 years
      that may facilitate more effective social media communication.

TI  - The Quality, Reliability, and Popularity of YouTube Education Videos for
      Vestibular Rehabilitation: A Cross-sectional Study.
PG  - e1077-e1083
LID - 10.1097/MAO.0000000000003197 [doi]
AB  - HYPOTHESIS: Vestibular rehabilitation (VR) education videos on YouTube are
      poor-quality and unreliable. BACKGROUND: YouTube has become a health information 
      source. Recent studies have determined that videos on YouTube contain misleading 
      and inappropriate information for different medical conditions. The aim of the
      present study was to assess the quality and reliability of VR education videos.
      METHODS: A search was performed using the keywords vertigo, vertigo treatment,
      vertigo exercise, and vestibular rehabilitation, on YouTube. The first 50 videos 
      for each keyword were analyzed. Videos were divided into four groups according to
      the video source: Group 1: universities/occupational organizations, Group 2:
      medical ad/profit-oriented companies, Group 3: independent users, and Group 4:
      others (news/media/state institution). The quality and reliability of videos were
      evaluated regarding the modified DISCERN criteria, the modified Journal of the
      American Medical Association (JAMA) benchmark criteria, and global quality scores
      (GQS). RESULTS: Among the 200 videos analyzed, 103 were included. The main video 
      source was medical ad/profit-oriented companies (60.2%). The mean modified
      DISCERN criteria score, the mean modified JAMA benchmark criteria score, and the 
      mean GQS value of the videos were found as low (2.46 +/- 1.37, 2.09 +/- 1.23, and
      2.67 +/- 1.38, respectively). Videos uploaded by universities/occupational
      organizations (25.2%) had statistically significant higher modified DISCERN
      criteria scores, modified JAMA benchmark criteria scores, and GQS values compared
      with the other groups (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Online information about VR
      education on YouTube was of poor quality and unreliable. Expert vestibular
      providers should be aware of these inappropriate sources and educate patients
      regarding the poor-quality of videos and also aim to provide more quality and
      reliable sources of information.

PG  - 378-382
LID - 10.1055/s-0039-3400223 [doi]
AB  - Objective This study aimed to determine the incidence of postoperative venous
      thromboembolism (VTE) in adults undergoing neurotologic surgery at a single
      center. Methods The records of adults undergoing neurotologic surgery from August
      2009 to December 2016 at a tertiary care hospital were reviewed for VTE within 30
      postoperative days. Particular attention was focused on postoperative diagnosis
      codes, imaging, and a keyword search of postoperative notes. Caprini risk scores 
      were calculated. Results Among 387 patients, 5 experienced postoperative VTE
      including 3 cases of pulmonary embolism (PE) and 2 cases of isolated deep vein
      thrombosis (DVT). All patients were given sequential compression devices
      perioperatively, and none received preoperative chemoprophylaxis. Patients with
      Caprini score > 8 had a significantly higher rate of VTE compared with those < 8 
      (12.5 vs. 1%, p = 0.004). Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed the
      Caprini risk assessment model to be a fair predictor of VTE, with a C-statistic
      of 0.70 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.49-0.92). Conclusion While no specific
      validated VTE risk stratification scheme has been widely accepted for patients
      undergoing neurotologic surgery, the Caprini score appears to be a useful
      predictor of risk. The benefits of chemoprophylaxis should be balanced with the
      risks of intraoperative bleeding, as well as the potential for postoperative
      intracranial hemorrhage.

TI  - Lymphoproliferative malignancies in patients with neurofibromatosis 1.
PG  - 230
LID - 10.1186/s13023-021-01856-8 [doi]
AB  - Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is an inherited, autosomal-dominant, tumor
      predisposition syndrome with a birth incidence as high as 1:2000. A patient with 
      NF1 is four to five times more likely to develop a malignancy as compared to the 
      general population. The number of epidemiologic studies on lymphoproliferative
      malignancies in patients with NF1 is limited. The aim of this study was to
      determine the incidence rate of lymphoproliferative malignancies (lymphoma and
      leukemia) in NF1 patients followed in our referral center for neurofibromatoses. 
      We used the Informatics for Integrated Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) platform to
      extract information from the hospital's electronic health records. We performed a
      keyword search on clinical notes generated between Jan/01/2014 and May/11/2020
      for patients aged 18 years or older. A total of 1507 patients with confirmed NF1 
      patients aged 18 years and above were identified (mean age 39.2 years; 57%
      women). The total number of person-years in follow-up was 57,736 (men, 24,327
      years; women, 33,409 years). Mean length of follow-up was 38.3 years (median, 36 
      years). A total of 13 patients had a medical history of either lymphoma or
      leukemia, yielding an overall incidence rate of 22.5 per 100,000 (0.000225, 95%
      confidence interval (CI) 0.000223-0.000227). This incidence is similar to that of
      the general population in France (standardized incidence ratio 1.07, 95% CI
      0.60-1.79). Four patients had a medical history leukemia and 9 patients had a
      medical history of lymphoma of which 7 had non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and 2 had
      Hodgkin lymphoma. Our results show that adults with NF1 do not have an increased 
      tendency to develop lymphoproliferative malignancies, in contrast to the general 
      increased risk of malignancy. While our results are consistent with the recent
      population-based study in Finland, they are in contrast with the larger
      population-based study in England whereby NF1 individuals were found to be 3
      times more likely to develop both non-Hodgkin lymphoma and lymphocytic leukemia. 
      Large-scale epidemiological studies based on nationwide data sets are thus needed
      to confirm our findings.

TI  - African families' and caregivers' experiences of raising a child with
      intellectual disability: A narrative synthesis of qualitative studies.
PG  - 827
LID - 10.4102/ajod.v10i0.827 [doi]
AB  - Background: The prevalence of intellectual disability was high in Africa,
      particularly amongst low socio-economic communities. Despite this, there was
      limited literature on primary caregivers and parents of people with intellectual 
      disabilities regarding their experience raising an individual with the condition,
      especially within the African context. Objectives: The aim of the current
      systematic review was to investigate experiences of caregivers and parents of
      children with intellectual disability in Africa. Method: We used strict
      eligibility criteria to identify suitable studies. We identified Medical Subject 
      Headings (MeSH) terms and other keyword terms and, after conducting searches in
      electronic databases, identified articles that met the inclusion criteria for
      articles published between 1975 and the end of 2019. Results: 164 articles were
      assessed for eligibility. Nine studies met the review's criteria. Six major
      themes emerged: understanding of intellectual disability (ID), worries about the 
      future, burden of care, lack of services, coping strategies and stigma and
      discrimination. Conclusion: Caregivers of children with intellectual disability
      in Africa faced substantial challenges. Current findings suggested that there was
      the need for both formal and alternative healthcare workers to work together
      towards an understanding and management of intellectual disability in Africa.
